TrustGeek code


This repo is where I will store the TrustGeek code. TrustGeek is a cybersecurity company specializing in CCPA compliance. 
Whatever coding solution is required will be stored in folders in this repo. 
The first task is to create a privacy policy analysis Python script. The goal is to scrape
a company's privacy policy from this spreadsheet (acquired via Apollo.io), and feed it into 
a LLM in order to determine whether or not this priavcy policy is compliant with CCPA standards. 
We will create a different python script for different compliance standards. 
But we will start with CCPA since that is what I am most familiar with.

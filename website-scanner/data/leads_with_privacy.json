        "privacy policy": "Earth AI | Privacy Policy\nMenu\nTechnology\nExplore with us\nPrivacy Policy\nLast Updated: September 18\nth\n 2023\n \nWelcome to Earth AI! This Privacy Notice explains how Earth AI Inc. (\"Earth AI,\" \"our,\" \"we,\" or \"us\") collects, uses, and discloses personal information in connection with our website, \nwww.earth-ai.com\n, and all related services (including contact with our team, engagement with us on social media, or other related interactions with us) (collectively the \u201cservices\u201d).\n \nThis Privacy Notice does not address our privacy practices relating to Earth AI job applicants, employees and other personnel. This Privacy Notice is also not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations. \n \nOUR COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n \nEarth AI is the controller of the personal information we collect or otherwise maintain in connection with our services. This means that we determine how and why personal information is processed. \n \nThe categories of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us and our services. Earth AI collects information that individuals provide directly to us, information we collect automatically when individuals interact with us, and information we collect from third-party sources and other organizations.\n \nPersonal Information Individuals Provide Directly to Us\n \nWe may collect the following personal information individuals provide directly to us in connection with our services:\n \n \nContact Information, including name, email address, and company affiliation.\n \nAccount Information, including username, log-in credentials, profile description, general location. \n \nInquiry Information, including information provided in custom messages sent through our services or provided directly to a member of our team. \n \n \nWhen an individual chooses to contact us, we may need additional information to fulfill the request or respond to inquiries. We may provide additional privacy-related information where the scope of the inquiry/request and/or personal information we require fall outside the scope of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional privacy notice will govern how we may process the information provided at that time.\n \nPersonal Information Automatically Collected\n \nAs is true of many digital platforms, we and our third-party providers may also collect certain personal information from an individual\u2019s device, browsing actions, and site usage patterns automatically when visiting or interacting with our services, which may include:\n \n \nLog Data, such as cookie identifiers, internet protocol (IP) address, mobile carrier, MAC address, user settings, mobile ad identifiers, Internet service provider, browser or device information, the URL entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of visit, the time spent on our services, and any errors that may occur during the visit to our services.\n \nAnalytics Data, such as the electronic path taken to our services, through our services, and when exiting our services, as well as information pertaining to usage and activity on our services (including  pages visited, links clicked, content interacted with, and duration and frequency of the activities). \n \nLocation Data, such as general geographic location based on the log data we or our third-party providers collect.\n \n \nFor information about our and our third-party providers\u2019 use of cookies and related technologies to collect information automatically, and any choices individuals may have in relation to its collection, please review the Cookies and Related Technologies section below.\n \nPersonal Information from Third Parties and Other Sources\n \nWe also obtain personal information from third-party sources, which we often combine with personal information we collect either automatically or directly from an individual. \n \nWe may receive the same categories of personal information as described above from the following third parties: \n \n \nAffiliates: We may receive personal information from other companies affiliated with Earth AI, and other companies owning or under common ownership with Earth AI, particularly when we collaborate in providing services. \n \nCommunity Participants: We may receive personal information from other participants in the Earth AI community to help support an individual\u2019s interaction with the Earth AI.\n \nSocial Media: If an individual chooses to interact with us on social media, we may collect personal information about them from their social media account that they make public. We use personal information collected in connection with their social media account to communicate with them, better understand their interests and preferences, and better understand our user base in the aggregate. \n \nEvents: We may from time to time offer opportunities for individuals to take part in events. Our event partners may collect or share personal information with us in connection with the relevant event, or service. For example, we may receive personal information from third-party business partners that organize conferences or trade shows based on individual\u2019s expressed interests. \n \nData Analytics Providers: We rely on third-party providers to help us collect analytics relating to our services and user base. These data analytics providers often collect personal information directly from individuals and share some or all of this information with us in connection with their analytics services. \n \nOther Service Providers: Other service providers that perform services solely on our behalf, such as website hosting and marketing providers, collect personal information and often share some or all of this information with us in connection with their services. \n \nInformation Providers: We may from time to time obtain information from third-party information providers to correct or supplement personal information we collect. For example, we may obtain updated contact information from third-party information providers to connect with an individual who may be interested in our services. \n \nPublicly Available Sources: We collect personal information about individuals that we do not otherwise have, such as contact information or an individual\u2019s interest in our services, from publicly available sources. We may combine this information with the information we collect from an individual directly. \n \n \nOUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n \nWe use the information we collect to: \n \n \nManage our organization and its day-to-day operations; \n \nAdminister, provide, maintain, improve, and personalize our products and services;\n \nImprove and support the Earth AI community; \n \nFacilitate identity and transaction management services at your request; \n \nProcess or otherwise facilitate transactions and send you related information, including confirmations, receipts, invoices, customer experience surveys, and recall notices;\n \nPersonalize and improve your experience on our services;\n \nSend you technical notices, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;\n \nRespond to your comments and questions and provide customer service;\n \nCommunicate with you about products, services, and events offered by Earth AI and others and provide news and information that we think will interest you;\n \nMonitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our services;\n \nTest, enhance, update, and monitor the services, diagnose or fix technology problems, and to help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our property and services, technology assets, and business; \n \nDefend, protect, or enforce our rights or applicable contracts and agreements; \n \nDetect, prevent, investigate, or provide notice of security incidents or other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity and protect the rights and property of Earth AI and others;\n \nFacilitate business transactions and reorganizations impacting the structure of our business; \n \nComply with our legal and financial obligations; and\n \nCarry out any other purpose described to you at the time the information was collected.\n \n \nOUR DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION \n \nWe disclose the information we collect to:\n \n \nAffiliates: We share information with other companies affiliated with Earth AI, and other companies owning or under common ownership with Earth AI, particularly when we collaborate in providing services.\n \nReferrals: We may share the name of a referring individual with the friends and family the individual refers to our services, as well as any other content or custom message the referring individual wishes to share. \n \nEvent Partners: Just as we may receive information from our event partners, we may share information with them in connection with the relevant event or service we are offering. For example, we may share information with third-party business partners that help foster the Earth AI community in order to have them facilitate communication between us and members of the Earth AI community. \n \nData Analytics Providers: We may share information with our data analytics providers to facilitate the analytics services they are providing us. \n \nOther Service Providers: In addition to the third parties identified above, we engage other third-party service providers that perform business or operational services for us or on our behalf, such as web hosting, fraud prevention, customer service, and marketing services. Depending on the function the provider serves, the service provider may process information on our behalf or have access to information while performing functions on our behalf. \n \nBusiness Transaction or Reorganization: We may share or otherwise disclose personal to a third party during negotiations concerning, in connection with, or as an asset in a merger, sale or other transfer of company assets, joint venture, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company. Personal information may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership. \n \nLegal Obligations and Rights: We share or otherwise disclose information to third parties, such as our lawyers, other professional advisors and law enforcement: \n \nWhere necessary to obtain advice or otherwise protect and manage our business interests;\n \nIn connection with the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims;\n \nTo comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;\n \nTo protect our rights and property and the rights and property of others, including to enforce our agreements and policies; \n \nTo detect, suppress, or prevent fraud; \n \nTo protect the health and safety of us and others; or \n \nAs otherwise required by applicable law. \n \n \n \nOtherwise with Consent or Direction: We may share or otherwise disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share certain information with a third-party app or platform to verify your online identity or transactions at your direction in connection with Identity Connect (as further described below). \n \n \nWe also share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.\n \nCOOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES\n \nWe engage third parties to provide us with analytics and other services across the web and in mobile apps. We and our third-party providers may use (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual\u2019s computer and (ii) other, similar technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, \u201ccookies\u201d) to automatically collect personal information and use or disclose the personal information for the purposes described in the sections above, including to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand each user\u2019s online activity. Some examples of our third-party cookie providers include:\n \n \nGoogle Analytics. For more information about how Google uses your data, please visit \nGoogle Analytics Privacy Policy\n. You can also view Google\u2019s currently available opt-out options for Google Analytics \nhere\n.\n \n \nIf an individual would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow the individual to: (i) change the individual\u2019s browser settings to notify the individual when the individual receives a cookie, which lets the individual choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set the individual\u2019s browser to automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively impact the individual\u2019s experience using our website, as some features and offerings may not work properly or at all. Depending on the individual\u2019s device and operating system, the individual may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if the individual wants to reject cookies across all browsers and devices, the individual will need to do so on each browser on each device the individual actively uses. \n \nThe individual may also set their email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether they have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.\n \nREGION-SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES\n \nWe may choose or be required by law to provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal information about residents of certain countries, regions or states. Please see below for disclosures that may be applicable to you:\n \n \nIf you are a resident of the State of California or Nevada in the United States, please see the Additional United States Privacy Disclosures below. \n \n \nCHILDREN\u2019S PERSONAL INFORMATION\n \nOur services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. If an individual is under the age of 13, they should not use our services or otherwise provide us with any personal information either directly or by other means. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child\u2019s parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the personal information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal information.\n \nLINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE OR SERVICE\n \nOur services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications. Except where we post, link to, or expressly adopt or refer to this Privacy Notice, this Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, any personal information practices of third-party websites and online services or the practices of other third parties. To learn about the personal information practices of third parties, please visit their respective privacy notices. \n \nUPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE\n \nWe may change this Privacy Notice from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this notice and, if we make material changes, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our services or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.\n \nCONTACT US\n \nIf you have any questions or requests in connection with this Privacy Notice or other privacy-related matters, please send an email to: \ncontact@earth-ai.com\n \nADDITIONAL UNITED STATES PRIVACY DISCLOSURES\n \nNevada Residents \n \nIf you are a resident of the state of Nevada in the United States, Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes permits a Nevada resident to opt out of future sales of certain covered information that a website operator has collected or will collect about the resident. Although we do not currently sell covered information, please contact us at \ncontact@earth-ai.com\n with the subject line \u201cNevada Opt Out Request\u201d to submit such a request.  \n \nCalifornia Residents\n \nThe remainder of this section supplements the information contained in our Privacy Notice by providing additional information about our personal information processing practices relating to individual residents of the State of California. For a detailed description of how we collect, use, and disclose personal information in connection with our services, please read the Privacy Notice above. \n \nNo Sales or Targeted Advertising\n \nWe do not sell personal information, and we do not process or otherwise share personal information for the purpose of displaying advertisements that are selected based on personal information obtained or inferred over time from an individual\u2019s activities across non-affiliated businesses or websites, applications, or other services (otherwise known as \u201ctargeted advertising\u201d or \u0000\u201ccross-context behavioral advertising\u201d). \n \nSensitive Information \n \nWe do not currently collect personal information that may be classified as \u201csensitive\u201d under applicable privacy laws. \n \nDeidentified Information \n \nWe may at times receive, or process personal information to create, deidentified information that can no longer reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual or household. Where we maintain deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the information except as required or permitted by law. \n \nYour Privacy Rights\n \nDepending on your state of residency and subject to certain legal limitations and exceptions, you may be able to exercise some or all of the following rights: \n \n \nRight to Know: The right to confirm whether we are processing personal information about you and, under California law only, to obtain certain personalized details about the personal information we have collected about you, including: \n \nThe categories of personal information collected;\n \nThe categories of sources of the personal information;\n \nThe purposes for which the personal information were collected; \n \nThe categories of personal information disclosed to third parties (if any), and the categories of recipients to whom the personal information were disclosed;\n \nThe categories of personal information shared for targeted advertising purposes (if any), and the categories of recipients to whom the personal information were disclosed for those purposes; and\n \nThe categories of personal information sold (if any), and the categories of third parties to whom the personal information were sold.\n \n \n \nRight to Access & Portability: The right to obtain access to the personal information we have collected about you and, where required by law, the right to obtain a copy of the personal information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another entity without hindrance.\n \nRight to Correction: The right to correct inaccuracies in your personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information.\n \nRight to Deletion: The right to have us delete the personal information we maintain about you. \n \n \nYou also have the right to not receive retaliatory or discriminatory treatment in connection with a request to exercise the above rights. However, the exercise of the rights described above may result in a different price, rate or quality level of product or service where that difference is reasonably related to the impact the right has on our relationship or is otherwise permitted by law. \n \nSubmitting Privacy Rights Requests\n \nTo submit a request to exercise one of the privacy rights identified above, please send an email to \ncontact@earth-ai.com\n \nBefore processing your request, we may need to verify your identity and confirm you are a resident of a state that offers the requested right(s). In order to verify your identity, we will generally either require the successful authentication of a community membership, or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems.  We may at times need to request additional information from you, taking into consideration our relationship with you and the sensitivity of your request. \n \nWe will only use the personal information provided in the verification process to verify your identity or authority to make a request and to track and document request responses, unless you initially provided the information for another purpose. In certain circumstances, we may decline a privacy rights request, particularly where you are not a resident of one of the eligible states or where we are unable to verify your identity. \n \nSubmitting Authorized Agent Requests\n \nIn certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf through the designated methods set forth above where we can verify the authorized agent\u2019s authority to act on your behalf. In order to verify the authorized agent\u2019s authority, we generally require evidence of either (i) a valid power of attorney or (ii) a signed letter containing your name and contact information, the name and contact information of the authorized agent, and a statement of authorization for the request. Depending on the evidence provided and your state of residency, we may still need to separately reach out to you to confirm the authorized agent has permission to act on your behalf and to verify your identity in connection with the request. \n \nAppealing Privacy Rights Decisions\n \nDepending on your state of residency, you may be able to appeal a decision we have made in connection with your privacy rights request. All appeal requests should be submitted by replying to the communication resolving your original request. \n \nCalifornia Categories of Personal Data\n \nCalifornia law requires we provide disclosures to you about what personal information we collect by reference to the enumerated categories of personal information set forth within California law. To address this obligation, we have identified the relevant enumerated California personal information category for the personal information described in the Our Collection of Personal Information section of our Privacy Notice, as well as the categories of personal information we collect from representatives of third-party entities, below: \n \n \nIdentifiers, including name, email address, and social media handles. \n \nCustomer Records, including account information and referral information, \n \nInternet/Network Information, including Log Data and Analytics Data. \n \nGeolocation Data, including general geographic location based on the log data we or our third-party providers collect.  \n \nProfessional / Employment Information, including the business or organization an individual represents, their title with that business or organization and information relating to their role with the business or organization, which we use to communicate with the individual about the business or organization they represent. \n \nOther Personal Data, including communication preferences, inquiry information, personal information an individual permits us to see when interacting with us through social media, and personal information an individual provides us in relation to a question, request, inquiry, survey, contest or promotion.\n \n \nWe disclose all of these categories of personal information for a business purpose to service providers or other third parties at the consumer\u2019s direction, as outlined in the Our Disclosure of Personal Information section of our Privacy Notice. \n \nRetention of Personal Information \n \nWe retain personal information only for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. However, if necessary, we may retain personal information for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator or other government authority. To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other applicable obligations.\nHome\nTechnology\nContact\nUs Headquarters\n400 Concar Dr.\nSan Mateo, CA 94402,\n USA\nAustralia Head Office\nUnit 8/7-29 Bridge Rd.\nStanmore NSW 2048,\n Australia\n@ \n2025\n Earth AI\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy"

Information We Process on Behalf of our Customers\n\n\nOur Services are intended for use by our business customers. As a result, for much of the Personal Data we process through the Services, we act as a processor or service provider on behalf of our business customers. This means that it is our business customers who control what Personal Data we collect through the Services and how we use it. Where our activities as a processor or service provider are clear and consistent across our customer base, we have described those activities herein in the interests of transparency. However, if you are a Service User, and have privacy-related questions or concerns about the privacy practices of or the choices the relevant business customer has made regarding your information via the Services, you should contact the relevant customer (e.g. your employer) directly or review their privacy notices.\n\n\nWe are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of our business customers, which may differ from those set forth in this Policy.\n\n\n3.

We may also record or monitor our telephone or other communications with you, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\n\nProviding your Personal Data is optional, but it may be necessary for certain Services, such as in relation to Services account registration and management data. In such cases, if you do not provide your Personal Data, Abmatic AI may not be able to provide you with the requested Services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Data we collect automatically:\n When you use or interact with the Services and Marketing Activities, we automatically collect or receive certain information through our Services (for example in log files) and through other technologies (such as cookies) about your device and usage of the Services.

We may also share your Personal Data with our marketing service providers to help us better market our products and services to you.

Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, analytics and marketing or advertising services, and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. These third parties may act as our service providers, or in certain conte\nxts, independently decide how to process your Personal Data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartners:\n Abmatic AI may share business contact information, marketing information, troubleshooting, and support data with business partners of ours (including referral partners, resellers, and managed service providers), for the purpose of assisting with sales, marketing, and support activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerger or acquisition:\n We may share all categories of your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal Requirements:\n Abmatic AI may disclose any categories of your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation or other legal process, and where required, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Abmatic AI, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsent:\n To any other person you have consented to us sharing Personal Data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout limiting the foregoing, we may share aggregated information that does not identify you or de-identified information with other parties or affiliates except as prohibited by applicable law. For information on your rights and choices regarding how we share your information, please see Your Privacy Rights and Choices.\n\n\n6. Social Media and Technology Integrations\n\n\nOur Services and Marketing Activities contain content from and hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms, and services operated, owned, and maintained by third parties. In addition, we integrate technologies operated or controlled by other parties. For example, we hyperlink from our Site and Services to websites, social media platforms, and other services not operated or controlled by us. These other parties may use tracking technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you. Also, if you use one of their features, both we and the applicable other party may have access to and use information associated with your use of that feature. If you publicly reference our Site or Services or Marketing Activities on a social network (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Abmatic AI in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Services and Marketing Activities.\n\n\nThe information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Services and Marketing Activities, or another party\u2019s service or device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. Abmatic AI is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the privacy practices of third parties. You should carefully read their own privacy policies before providing any information to such parties.\n\n\n7. Cookies and other Tracking Technologies\n\n\nWe may, and we may allow third-party service providers to, use cookies or other tracking technologies to automatically collect information from your computer or mobile device about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Site, your interaction with our Marketing Activities as well as in connection with the Services.\n\n\nFor example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (\u201cGoogle\u201d). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze your use of the Services and Marketing Activities, compile statistical reports on the service's activity, and provide other services relating to your activities and internet usage. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to \nwww.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/\n.\n\n\nYou can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of the Site. For more information, and to manage how Abmatic AI collects and stores non-essential cookies, please see our Cookie Manager.\n\n\n8. Security\n\n\nAbmatic AI takes reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Abmatic AI via the Internet.\n\n\n9. Retention\n\n\nWe may retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary for the purposes it was collected, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary. We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data based on the amount, nature, and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation). After the expiry of the applicable retention periods, your Personal Data will be deleted. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further use of that data. For further information on applicable data retention periods, please see the section entitled Contact Abmatic AI.\n\n\n10. Transfers of Your Personal Data\n\n\nPersonal Data we collect may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, or any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. We maintain primary data hosting centers in the United States. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Privacy Policy and according to applicable law wherever the data is located.\n\n\nTherefore, we may transfer Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and Switzerland (collectively, \u201cEurope\u201d) to other countries that may not have the same level of data protection that applies in your jurisdiction. In these cases, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to ensure that the recipient of your Personal Data offers an adequate level of protection, including entering into the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of European data approved by the European Commission, or where required, we will ask you for your prior consent.\n\n\n11. Additional Disclosures for U.S. Residents\n\n\nThis section describes how Abmatic AI collects, uses, and discloses your Personal Data pursuant to the following U.S. state privacy laws:\n\n\n\n\nthe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CCPA);\n\n\nthe Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA);\n\n\nthe Colorado Privacy Act (CPA);\n\n\nthe Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CDPA); and\n\n\nthe Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA).\n\n\n\n\nThis section applies only if you live in the US states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, Utah, or any other US state that has enacted similar privacy laws. This section also describes the rights you have with regard to your Personal Data, which apply when these laws take effect in these states. This section does not apply to any of our employees, owners, directors, officers, or contractors.\n\n\nSince the rules and regulations implementing some of these laws have not yet been finalized, we will continue to update our processes and disclosures as well as this section once these implementing rules and regulations are finalized. Certain terms used herein have the meanings given to them in the respective state privacy laws.\n\n\nCategories, Sources, and Use of Personal Data we collect:\n\n\nThe categories of Personal Data we collect and the sources from which we collect it are described in detail in the section entitled The Personal Data We Collect. The business and commercial purposes for which we collect this information are described in the section entitled Our Use of Your Personal Data.\n\n\nIn addition, and specifically with respect to job applicants, Abmatic AI may collect Personal Data:\n\n\n\n\nthat contains characteristics that may be protected classifications under California or Federal Law solely to the extent such characteristics are voluntarily disclosed to us or contained in any content transmitted across or stored on our network (e.g., age, ethnicity, race, languages spoken, and gender);\n\n\nwhich includes sensitive Personal Data as defined under the CCPA (such as social security number, driver\u2019s license, state identification card, passport number, the contents of mail/email and text messages (unless we are the intended recipient of the communication), precise geolocation, and health information).\n\n\n\n\nWe collect sensitive Personal Data in relation to job applicants for various purposes, including:\n\n\n\n\nto uniquely identify you;\n\n\nto comply with our legal obligations pursuant to applicable federal and state employment laws and regulations, including collecting and disclosing Personal Data as required by law (e.g., for minimum wage, payroll tax, as well as to comply with equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws);\n\n\nto facilitate and provide reasonable accommodations; and\n\n\nto facilitate other business purposes as enumerated under the CCPA.\n\n\n\n\nAs defined by the CCPA, sensitive Personal Data shall be treated as Personal Data, except where it is collected or processed for \u201cthe purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer.\u201d We do not collect or process sensitive Personal Data for the purpose of inferring characteristics about individuals.\n\n\nSale or Disclosure of Personal Data\n\n\nThis section only applies where Abmatic AI is acting as a business, and not a service provider, under applicable US data protection laws. The categories of third parties to whom we \"disclose\" your Personal Data, and the categories of information disclosed for a business purpose are described in the section entitled Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data.\n\n\nWhen we disclose Personal Data for a Business Purpose, we enter into a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to keep that Personal Data confidential and use it only for the purposes specified in the contract, and not for any other purpose. We share or make your information available, including any Personal Data, in the circumstances described below.\n\n\nWhile Abmatic AI does not sell Personal Data in exchange for any monetary consideration, we may share Personal Data for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes and for other benefits as defined by certain state privacy laws, such as the CCPA under Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140(ad)(2). Some of our processing activities may also constitute \u201ctargeted advertising\u201d as that term is defined under certain state laws.\n\n\nWe have shared in the preceding 12 months Personal Data as necessary for business purposes, as defined by Cal. Civ. Code 1798.140. This includes sharing personal identifiers, commercial information, and internet or other electronic network activity with customer relationship management, consulting, email, product feedback, helpdesk services, advertising networks, and website analytics companies.\n\n\nWe make Personal Data available to the following categories of third parties:\n\n\n\n\npartners (including analytics providers);\n\n\nmarketing service providers;\n\n\naffiliated persons, third-party service providers, and partners assisting us in the operation, management, improvement, research, and analysis of the Site, Marketing Activities, and Services. Affiliated persons or our third-party service providers may augment, extend, and combine non-personally identifiable information with data from additional third-party sources in order to assist us with the above. Use of information by affiliated persons and third-party service providers will be subject to this Policy or an agreement that is at least as restrictive as this Policy.\n\n\n\n\nYou have a right to direct Abmatic AI not to sell or share your Personal Data. We do not have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared Personal Data of individuals under the age of 16 for targeted advertising or cross-context behavioral advertising purposes.\n\n\n12.

From time to time we may also allow interested parties (Site users) to submit comments or inquiries to us via the Site, for business purposes. \n\n\nSection 3. The Types of Information That We Collect, and How We Collect It\n\n\nIn order to provide our services, we may collect data which are not personally identifiable (\u201cAnonymous Data\u201d); and we also collect data which either alone or in conjunction with other data could be used to identify an individual or household (referred to hereafter as \u201cPersonal Data\u201d or \u201cPD\u201d). Collectively Anonymous Data and Personal Data are referred to herein as \u201cData\u201d. Data may be collected in the following ways: \n\n\nA.\tAccount Data: \n We collect Personal Data that is provided to us voluntarily either via direct communications (e.g., email) or through our Site, such as when a Site visitor requests additional information from us.

We use Account Data to provide our services to you; and we may also use Account Data to contact parties for limited marketing or product communication purposes (subject to the provisions herein). \n\n\nB.\tSite Usage Data: \n We collect certain Site utilization data through the use of tracking technologies (including cookies, as detailed below), and the data so collected can include both Anonymous Data (e.g. how a Site is used) and Personal Data (e.g. a device ID). We refer to these data as \u201cSite Usage Data\u201d.

Information regarding your activity on the Site such as the time and frequency of access, a referrer page domain, pages viewed, and interactions between the User and the Site.\n\n\nIf we combine Personal Data with Anonymous Data, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Data for as long as it remains combined.\n\n\nSection 4. Cookies \n\n\nWe try to limit the use of cookies (small text files placed on your web browser or device) or similar technologies on our Site, but you should know that, from time to time, we may use these kinds of technologies; and we may analyze the information derived from them for the same purposes as set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

Due to their convenience and versatility, QR Codes are widely used to personalize marketing campaigns, improve product packaging, promote events, and share shipping or tracking information.\n \n \n \n \n \nHow can I create a QR Code with Bitly?\n \n \n \nCreating a QR Code with Bitly is quick and simple.\n \n \nSign up for or sign into your Bitly account.\n \nGo to \nCreate new\n and select \nQR Code\n from the options.\n \nEnter the \nDestination URL\n for the information you\u2019d like to encode (and any code details if applicable, like customized domain or back-half options for the short link generated alongside your QR Code).\n \nSelect \nDesign your code\n and customize your QR Code style, colors, logo (or center text), frame, corners, and branding (available in some plans).\n \nSelect \nCreate your code\n and that\u2019s it\u2014you\u2019re ready to go!

And for brands needing hundreds or thousands of codes per month (or more), our custom enterprise solutions are ideal!\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat types of content can I link to with a Bitly QR Code?\n \n \n \nBitly QR Codes can link to anything with a URL attached. This means you can create customized QR Codes that link to specific web pages, digital experiences, PDFs hosted on websites, and promotional content.\n \nBrands can use Bitly QR Codes nearly everywhere that information is shared:\n \n \nProduct packaging\n \nOrder confirmations\n \nSMS marketing campaigns\n \nDigital posters\n \nSocial media\n \nBillboards\n \nIndustry-specific media, like restaurant menus or real estate listings\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCan I customize the design of my QR Code?\n \n \n \nYes! It\u2019s easy to customize the look of your QR Code with Bitly\u2019s QR Code generator.

We may use the email address to send User information and updates pertaining to their order. It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests.\n\n\n\n\nHow we protect your information\n\n\nWe adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our Site.\n\n\nSharing your personal information\n\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or rent users\u2019 personal identification information to others.

In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites that have a link to our site, is subject to that website\u2019s own terms and policies.\n\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a California resident, California law may provide you with certain rights with regard to your personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). Throughout this Privacy Notice you will find information required by CCPA regarding the categories of personal information collected from you; the purposes for which we use personal information, and the categories of third parties your data may be shared with.\u00a0 This information is current as of the date of the Notice and is applicable in the 12 months preceding the effective date of the Notice.\n\n\n\u00a0As a California resident, the CCPA provides you the ability to make inquiries regarding your personal information. Specifically, the degree to which the information is not already provided in this Privacy Notice, you have the right to request disclosure about the collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months, including:\n\n\n\n\nThe categories of personal information collected about you.\n\n\nThe categories of sources for the personal information collected about you.\n\n\nThe business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information.\n\n\nThe categories of third parties with whom your personal information was shared.\n\n\nThe specific pieces of personal information collected about you.\n\n\nIf your personal information was disclosed for a business purpose, the personal information categories disclosed and the categories of third parties to which the information was disclosed.\n\n\nIf your personal information was sold in the past 12 months, the personal information categories sold and the categories of third parties to which the information was sold.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that you may only make the above requests twice in a 12-month period. You also have the right to request that any of your personal information collected and retained be deleted, subject to certain exceptions. Finally, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by Etheric Networks INC or any business for exercising any of the rights provided under CCPA.\n\n\nYou may submit a request regarding your rights under CCPA by submitting a request through the \nfollowing form \nor by contacting us at one of the following: Phone (650) 446-3622 Email: \nsupport@ethericnetworks.com\n\n\nIf we receive a CCPA request from you, we will first make a determination regarding the applicability of the law, and we will then take steps to verify your identity prior to responding. The steps to verify your identity may vary based on our relationship with you, but, at a minimum, it will take the form of confirming and matching the information submitted in the request with information already held by Etheric Networks INC and/or contacting you through previously used channels to confirm that you submitted the request (i.e. confirming identity through the contact information that we have on file, not the contact information submitted to make the request).\n\n\nYour rights as stated here can also be exercised by an authorized agent on your behalf. Etheric Networks, Inc. will follow the standards set by the Attorney General of California regarding the designation of an authorized agent to exercise rights under CCPA. You may review information available from the Attorney General regarding how an individual can be designated as an authorized agent under CCPA.\n\n\nIn addition to CCPA, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Website who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please \ncontact us using this form \nor by one of the following: Phone (650) 446-3622 Email: \nsupport@ethericnetworks.com.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompliance with the Children\u2019s online privacy protection act\n\n\nProtecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we know to be under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13 years of age.\n\n\nChanges to this privacy policy\n\n\nEtheric Networks, Inc has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of our Site.

The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nIf you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.\n\n\nCookies\n\n\nIf you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.\n\n\nIf you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.\n\n\nWhen you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select \u201cRemember Me\u201d, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.\n\n\nIf you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.\n\n\nEmbedded content from other websites\n\n\nArticles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.\n\n\nThese websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCopyright:\n\n\nUnauthorized or commercial use of content or multimedia material (of any sort) displayed on the Aura Aerospace site (or associated websites) is prohibited.

This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.\n\n\nFor users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.\n\n\nWhat rights you have over your data\n\n\nIf you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you.

From time to time, Company may also release the Non- Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website. \nWeb Cookies\nA \u00e2\u0080\u009cWeb Cookie\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a string of information which assigns you a unique identification that a website stores on a user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s computer, and that the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website.

However, third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that users provide directly to those third parties, or that those third parties collect for themselves. These third parties include advertisers, providers of games, utilities, widgets and a variety of other third-party applications accessible through the Website. Company neither owns nor controls the third-party websites and applications accessible through the Website. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third party, or using a third-party application, whether by means of a link on the Website, directly through the Website or otherwise, and before providing any Personally- Identifying Information to any such third party, users should inform themselves of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website or application, and should take those steps necessary to, in those users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 discretion, protect their privacy.\u00c2\u00a0\nSECURITY\nWe take the security of your Personally-Identifying Information seriously and use reasonable electronic, personnel and physical measures to protect it from loss, theft, alteration or misuse. However, please be advised that even the best security measures cannot fully eliminate all risks. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We are not responsible for third-party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures. We are dedicated to protect all information on the Website as is necessary. However, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Personally-Identifying Information by keeping your password confidential. You should change your password immediately if you believe someone has gained unauthorized access to it or your account. If you lose control of your account, you should notify us immediately.\u00c2\u00a0\nPRIVACY POLICY CHANGES\nCompany may, in its sole discretion, change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes to Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Privacy Policy will be reflected on this page and the date new versions are posted will be stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. Users should regularly check this page for any changes to this Privacy Policy. Company will always post new versions of the Privacy Policy on the Website. However, Company may, as determined in its discretion, decide to notify users of changes made to this Privacy Policy via email or otherwise.

Any person who provides Personally-Identifying Information through the Website represents to us that he or she is 13 years of age or older. If we learn that Personally-Identifying Information has been collected from a user under 13 years of age on or through the Website, then we will take the appropriate steps to cause this information to be deleted. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a member of the Website or has otherwise transferred Personally-Identifying Information to the Website, please contact Company using our contact information below to have that child's account terminated and information deleted.\u00c2\u00a0\nCALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83,also known as the \"Shine The Light\" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about the Personally-Identifying Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.

The information that we collect and use varies depending on how you interact with us.\n\n\nIn addition to the specific uses set out below, we may use information we collect about you to communicate with you, provide the Services, comply with any applicable legal obligations, enforce any applicable terms of service, and to protect or defend the Services, our rights, and the rights of our users or others.\n\n\nWhat Personal Information We Collect\n\n\nThe types of personal information we obtain about you depends on how you interact with our Site and use our Services. When we use the term \"personal information\", we are referring to information that identifies, relates to, describes or can be associated with you.

We are not responsible or liable for the accuracy of the information provided to us by third parties and are not responsible for any third party's policies or practices. For more information, see the section below,\u00a0\nThird Party Websites and Links\n.\n\n\nHow We Use Your Personal Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunicating with you.\n\u00a0We use your personal information to provide you with customer support and improve our Services. This is in our legitimate interests in order to be responsive to you, to provide effective services to you, and to maintain our business relationship with you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProviding Products and Services.\n\u00a0We use your personal information to provide you with the Services in order to perform our contract with you, including to process your payments, fulfill your orders, to send notifications to you related to you account, purchases, returns, exchanges or other transactions, to create, maintain and otherwise manage your account, to arrange for shipping, facilitate any returns and exchanges and to enable you to post reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing and Advertising.\n\u00a0We use your personal information for marketing and promotional purposes, such as to send marketing, advertising and promotional communications by email, text message or postal mail, and to show you advertisements for products or services.

Such circumstances may include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith vendors or other third parties who perform services on our behalf (e.g., IT management, payment processing, data analytics, customer support, cloud storage, fulfillment and shipping).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith business and marketing partners, including Shopify, to provide services and advertise to you.\u00a0For example, we may use Shopify, or other platforms to support personalized advertising with third-party services.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way, we will post a notice on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.\n\n\nThis policy does not apply to third-party websites, products, or services even if they link to our services, and you should consider the privacy practices of those third parties carefully.\u00a0 By using our website and our services, you authorize the collection, use, storage, sharing, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and any applicable updates. If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use our websites or services.\n\n\nCollection and Use of Personal\u00a0Information\nPersonal information is information that can be used to identify or contact a single\u00a0person. Personal information may also include information that is confidential to your or your organization that you import into or use in connection with our products to create analyses and projections for your own use. Confidential information does not include any information or content provided by Waterfind that you may combine with your information to create such analyses and projections.\n\n\nYou will be asked to provide your personal (and/or your organization\u2019s) information to access most features of our website and services. Waterfind and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and with third parties consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the types of personal information Waterfind may collect and how we may use\u00a0it:\n\n\nWhat personal information we\u00a0collect\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create a Waterfind account, purchase a product, access our services, download a software update, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card or other financial information.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we have created, from publicly available records and domains, a database containing owners\u2019 names, addresses, parcel sizes and crops relating to agricultural land in the state of California.\n\n\nHow we use your personal\u00a0information\n\n\n\n\nThe personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Waterfind\u2019s latest product and service announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. We also package and add additional useful information to the information we gather through publicly available records and domains and sell this information to third parties, as well as use this information for our own marketing purposes. If you don\u2019t want to be on our mailing list, or if you do not otherwise want us to use the personal information that you provide to us as described in this Privacy Policy, you can opt out anytime by\u00a0updating your\u00a0preferences \u2013 see\u00a0Privacy Rights: \nOpting Out Of Marketing and Transfers; Accessing, Updating And Deleting Information\n\u00a0for information on how to opt out of marketing emails and how to update your personal information.\n\n\nWe also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\n\n\nWe may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Waterfind users.\n\n\nFrom time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Waterfind, you may not opt out of receiving these communications by contacting us at:\u00a0\u00a0info@waterfindusa.com.\n\n\nWe will use the information that we compile using public records and databases to contact producers with information regarding our products and services. For instance, we may send an electronic message to an email address available in a public record with our newsletter and access log-ins to a portal containing agricultural and water intelligence data.\n\n\nWe may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Waterfind\u2019s products, services, and customer communications.\n\n\n\n\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\nWe also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:\n\n\nWe may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your Internet Protocol (IP)\u00a0address.\n\n\nWith your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.\nIf we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.\n\n\nCookies and Other Technologies\nWaterfind\u2019s website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \u201ccookies\u201d and other technologies\u00a0such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non\u2011personal information. However, to the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\n\n\nIf you want to disable cookies and you\u2019re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to disable cookies.\u00a0 Other internet browsers also provide options for disabling cookies.\n\n\nAs is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\n\n\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Waterfind may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.\n\n\nIn some of our email messages, we use a \u201cclick-through URL\u201d linked to content on the Waterfind website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\n\n\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.\n\n\nDisclosure to Third Parties\nAt times Waterfind may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with Waterfind to provide products and services, or that help Waterfind market to customers. We may sell the information we gather using publicly available records and domains when we sell our other services. However, personal information supplied by you will only be shared by Waterfind to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\n\n\nService Providers\nWaterfind may share personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, fulfilling customer orders, delivering our services to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our other services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Waterfind operates.\n\n\nOthers\nIt may be necessary \u2212 by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your state of residence \u2212 for Waterfind to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\n\n\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms of service and subscription services agreement or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.\n\n\nProtection of Personal\u00a0Information\nWaterfind takes the security of your personal information very seriously. The Waterfind website, and online services are hosted by Amazon Web Services with its associated security protocols.\n\n\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\nWaterfind makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\n\n\nLocation-Based Services\nTo provide location-based services on Waterfind products, Waterfind and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer or device. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices\u2019 approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Waterfind and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.\n\n\nThird\u2011Party Sites and Services\nWaterfind\u2019s website, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.\n\n\nOur Companywide Commitment to Your\u00a0Privacy\nTo make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to our employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within our company.\n\n\nPrivacy Rights: Opting Out of Marketing and Transfers; Accessing, Updating And Deleting Information\nWe want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.

Depending on the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, we may not be allowed to provide notice to you of such required disclosure.\n\n\nPrivacy Questions\nIf you have any questions or concerns about Waterfind\u2019s Privacy Policy or data processing or if you would like to make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, please\u00a0contact us at\u00a0info@waterfindusa.com.

We will refer to cookies and similar technologies simply as \u201cCookies\u201d for the remainder of this Cookie Policy. We use Cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the Sites through the internet, to analyze trends, and to learn about our user base.\n\n\nWe may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through Cookies with other Personal Information that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties in order to enhance our Sites, or to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you. Where we use Cookies to collect information that is personally identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable if we combine it with other information, the applicable Privacy Policy will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.\n\n\nYou can control and/or delete Cookies as you wish \u2014 for details, see \nwww.aboutcookies.org\n. Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.

Your access and use of the Platform, any part thereof, or anything associated therewith, including its content (\u201cContent\u201d), any products or services provided through the Platform, and any affiliated website, software, or application owned or operated by FLI MD (collectively, including the Platform and the Content, the \u201cService\u201d).\n\n\nWe are committed to respecting the privacy of users of the Service. We created this Privacy Policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) to inform you how FLI MD collects, uses, and discloses information in order to provide you with the Service. As with our Terms of Use for the Service (the \u201cTerms of Use\u201d), if we make any changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and update the \u201cLast Revised\u201d date of the Privacy Policy.\n\n\nBy accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you are using the Service on behalf of an individual other than yourself, you represent that you are authorized by such individual to act on such individual\u2019s behalf and that such individual acknowledges the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.\n\n\nProtected Health Information\n\n\nFLI MD is not a \u201ccovered entity\u201d under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, and its related regulations and amendments from time to time (collectively, \u201cHIPAA\u201d), however, the Medical Group (as defined in our Terms of Use) may be a \u201ccovered entity\u201d and, solely in its role providing administrative services to the Medical Group, FLI MD may be a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of the Medical Group. Therefore, the Medical Group and, solely in its role as a business associate, FLI MD, may be subject to certain provisions of HIPAA with respect to \u201cprotected health information,\u201d as defined under HIPAA, that you provide to the Medical Group. PHI does not include information that has been de-identified in accordance with HIPAA (\u201cDe-Identified Health Information\u201d), and does not include information that you submit to FLI MD for purposes other than connecting you with the Medical Group or Providers.\n\n\nUnder HIPAA, a \u201ccovered entity\u201d is required to provide their patients a Notice of Privacy Practices that describes how the covered entity uses and discloses \u201cprotected health information\u201d (\u201cPHI\u201d). As a result, if the Medical Group determines that it is a covered entity under HIPAA, the Medical Group will adopt and separately provide to you a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices that describes how the the Medical Group may use or disclose your PHI (the \u201cMedical Group Notice of Privacy Practices\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHIPAA also requires a covered entity to obtain a patient authorization that satisfies certain requirements in order for the covered entity or its business associates to use or disclose PHI in certain ways. In order to ensure that the Medical Group and FLI MD are able to effectively provide their respective services to you and that you are able to utilize the full functionality of the Service, the Medical Group and/or FLI MD may need to use or disclose your PHI in ways that would require the Medical Group to obtain an authorization under HIPAA. As a result, if the Medical Group determines that it is a covered entity under HIPAA, the Medical Group will obtain from you a patient authorization (a \u201cPatient Authorization\u201d) that authorizes the Medical Group and FLI MD to use and disclose your PHI in certain ways that are described in the Patient Authorization.\n\n\nTo the extent that FLI MD is in fact a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of the Medical Group, FLI MD\u2019s use and disclosure of your PHI will comply with HIPAA and any Patient Authorization. Any information that does not constitute PHI may be used or disclosed in any manner permitted under this Privacy Policy.\n\n\nCollection of Information\n\n\nWe collect any information you provide when you use the Service, including, but not limited to: (1) personally identifying information (\u201cPII\u201d) such as your name and contact data such as your e-mail address, phone number, and billing and physical addresses; (2) your login and password; (3) demographic data (such as your gender, date of birth and zip code); (4) your communications with your Providers; and (5) any information you provide when you contact or communicate with us. We may also collect information from you necessary to provide you with services from your Providers, which may include, but is not limited to: (a) payment information; (b) insurance information; and (c) health and medical data (such as previous doctors or other healthcare providers you visited, your reason for visiting a healthcare provider, date of visit, medical history and condition, medications, images or videos and other medical and health information and data you share with us).\n\n\nIn addition to the information we collect directly from you, we may also collect certain information from the Medical Group and/or Providers who provide treatment or other services to you in connection with our Service. This information may include, but is not limited to, diagnoses, treatment plans (including prescription details) and notes, and is accessible and visible through certain components of the Service.\n\n\nWe may also receive information from third parties that pay for your care or provide you with treatment, laboratory care or prescription medication, which may include, for example, your prescription history, insurance policy, insurance eligibility and coverage, and laboratory test results.\n\n\nTo the extent that FLI MD is in fact a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of the Medical Group, FLI MD\u2019s use and disclosure of your PHI will comply with HIPAA and any Patient Authorization. Any information that does not constitute PHI may be used or disclosed in any manner permitted under this Privacy Policy.\n\n\nWe or our service providers may automatically collect certain information from the device through which you access the Service. This information includes, but is not limited to, your language preferences, your phone number or other unique device identifier (the International Mobile Equipment Identity or the Mobile Equipment ID number), the IP address of your device, the manufacturer, model and operating system of your device, the name and version of our Service you are using, information regarding your browser and information that allows us to personalize our Service. We or our service providers may also collect information about how you interact with our Service and any of our websites to which our Service links, such as how many times you use a specific part of our Service, the amount of time you spend using our Service, how often you use our Service, actions you take in our Service and how you engage with our Service.\n\n\nWe and our service providers may obtain information regarding your location or the location of your device through which you access our Service. Information regarding your location may be obtained directly from you when you provide us with information as part of the registration process.\n\n\nWe may store cookies (e.g., locally stored objects) in your computer\u2019s hard drive when you use the Service. These devices are used to help us speed up your future activities or to improve your experience by remembering the information that you have already provided to us. Some of our service providers may also use cookies to provide us with anonymous data and information regarding your use of the Service. At your option, you may block or delete devices from your hard drive. However, by disabling such tracking devices, you may not have access all features of the Service. For more about cookies, including links to web browser instructions for disabling and managing such tracking devices, visit www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.\n\n\nIn addition, we may use Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that helps operators (like FLI MD) understand how users (like you) engage with their applications. Google Analytics uses cookies to track your interactions with our Service and to collect information about how you use the Service. We then use the information to compile reports that help us improve the Service. Google Analytics collects, processes and creates reports about website trends without identifying individual users. For more information regarding Google Analytics visit \u201cHow Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps\u201d located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.\n\n\nUse of Information\n\n\nIn connection with providing the Service, we and our affiliates and service providers may use your information, subject to the limitations addressed in the Protected Health Information Section above, for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to: (a) verifying your identity and administering your user account (\u201cAccount\u201d), including processing your payments and fulfilling your orders; (b) communicating with you about the Service or your use of the Service, and sending you communications on behalf of the Medical Group or its Providers; (c) providing you customer support and responding to your requests or concerns; (d) facilitating the provision of services to you by the Medical Group or its Providers; (e) making certain information in your medical records accessible and available to you; (f) sending you push notifications (notifications may be enabled or disabled through your device or app settings depending on your device type); (g) detecting, preventing, investigating and responding to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, or other misuse of our Service or the Medical Group\u2019s services; (h) reviewing, monitoring, expanding or improving the Service; (i) reviewing and analyzing the efficacy of some or all of the Service; (j) identifying and creating new Content, software or tools offered through the Service; (k) developing, testing and offering other products and services, whether or not through the Service; (l) providing certain marketing communications or promotional materials relating to the Service that may be of interest to you; and (m) any other use permitted by applicable law.\n\n\nWe may use information regarding your location or the location of your device through which you access the Service for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to confirming you are located in a jurisdiction in which the Service is offered.\n\n\nWe may de-identify your information and use, create and sell such de-identified information, including De-Identified Health Information, for any business or other purpose not prohibited by applicable law.\n\n\nDisclosure of Information\n\n\nWe may disclose your information to third parties in connection with the provision of our Service or your Provider\u2019s provision of services or as otherwise permitted or required by law. For example, we may disclose your information to: (a) our third-party service providers that provide services such as the hosting of the Service, data analysis, IT services and infrastructure, customer service, e-mail delivery, auditing and other similar services; (b) the Medical Group or its Providers to schedule and fulfill appointments and provide healthcare services; (c) the Medical Group or Providers to whom you send messages through our Service; (d) the Medical Group or its Providers for treatment, payment or healthcare operations purposes; (e) third parties as we believe necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws; and (f) to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, liquidation or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock with such third party. We may de-identify your information and disclose such de-identified information, including De-Identified Health Information, for any purpose not prohibited by applicable law.\n\n\nOwnership of Information Submitted via the Service\n\n\nCertain Submissions you make may contain health information, which may be subject to HIPAA or related state-specific privacy laws and regulations. With respect to any such PHI, FLI MD\u2019s rights with respect to the use or disclosure of such PHI may be limited as and to the extent required under HIPAA or an applicable Patient Authorization. Subject to the limitations described above, any information you transmit to FLI MD via the Service, whether by direct entry, submission, email or otherwise, including data, questions, comments, forum communications, or suggestions (collectively, \u201cSubmissions\u201d), will, to the extent permitted under applicable law, be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and will become the property of FLI MD.

In addition to the foregoing, FLI MD shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to edit, duplicate, or alter the Submission in any manner for any purpose that FLI MD deems necessary or desirable, and you irrevocably waive any and all so-called moral rights you may have in the Submission. You further agree that you shall have no right of approval and no claim to compensation in connection with the Submission.\n\n\nUse by Minors\n\n\nOur Service is intended for use by individuals who are at least 18 years of age or such older age as may be required by applicable state laws in the jurisdiction in which an individual utilizes the Service.

The law's reach\n          stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in\n          the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites\n          collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California\n          consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating\n          exactly the information being collected and those individuals or\n          companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:\n          http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf\n        \n\n\n\n\nAccording to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          Users can visit our site anonymously.\n        \n\n\n\n          Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our\n          home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after\n          entering our website.\n        \n\n\n\n          Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily\n          be found on the page specified above.\n        \n\n\n\n          You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:\n        \n\n\n\n\nOn our Privacy Policy Page\n\n\n\n\n\n          Can change your personal information:\n        \n\n\n\n\nBy emailing us\n\n\nBy calling us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does our site handle Do Not Track signals?\n\n\n\n\n\n          We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use\n          advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.\n        \n\n\n\n\nDoes our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?\n\n\n\n\n\n          It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral\n          tracking\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children\n          under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy\n          Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade\n          Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the\n          COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online\n          services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.\n        \n\n\n\n          We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years\n          old.\n        \n\n\n\n\nFair Information Practices\n\n\n\n\n\n          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy\n          law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a\n          significant role in the development of data protection laws around the\n          globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how\n          they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various\n          privacy laws that protect personal information.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take\n            the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n          We will notify you via email\n        \n\n\n\n\nWithin 7 business days\n\n\n\n\n\n          We will notify the users via in-site notification\n        \n\n\n\n\nWithin 1 business day\n\n\n\n\n\n          We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that\n          individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights\n          against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.\n          This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable\n          rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to\n          courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute\n          non-compliance by data processors.\n        \n\n\n\n\nCAN SPAM Act\n\n\n\n\n\n          The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,\n          establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the\n          right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out\n          tough penalties for violations.\n        \n\n\n\n\nTo be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n          If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future\n          emails, you can email us at\n          \ninfo@pulse.support\n and we will\n          promptly remove you from\n          \nALL\n correspondence.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContacting Us\n\n\n\n\n\n        If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may\n        contact us using the information below.\n      \n\n\n\n\ninfo@pulse.support\n\n\n\n\nLast Edited on 2021-02-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\n\n\nGet Started\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\nUse Cases\n\n\nIntegrations\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElasticsearch Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenSearch Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing Elasticsearch Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElasticsearch Monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\n\n\nCommon Elasticsearch Errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElasticsearch Query Language Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectory of Elasticsearch Settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenSearch Training for Platform Engineers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Never Miss an Update\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\n                    \n\n\n\n                      Subscribe\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \u00a9 2025 Data Ops Pulse Ltd.\n\n\n\n                    Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats are trademarks of\n                    Elasticsearch BV, registered in the U.S. and in other countries.

The law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. \u2013 See more at:\n \nhttps://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3\nAccording to CalOPPA we agree to the following:\n(a) users can visit our site anonymously;\n(b) our Privacy Policy link includes the word \u201cPrivacy\u201d, and can easily be found on the page specified above on the home page of our website;\n(c) users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;\n(d) users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at\n \nfounders@getomni.ai\n.\nOur Policy on \u201cDo Not Track\u201d Signals:\nWe honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.\nYou can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.\nYour Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\nIf you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:\n(a) \nWhat personal information we have about you.\n If you make this request, we will return to you:\n(i) The categories of personal information we have collected about you.\n(ii) The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information.\n(iii) The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\n(iv) The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.\n(v) The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.\n(vi) A list of categories of personal information that we have sold, along with the category of any other company we sold it to.

When you make this request, the information provided may be limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12\u00a0months.\n(b) \nTo delete your personal information.\n If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate.\n(c) \nTo stop selling your personal information.\n We don't sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.\nPlease note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.\nTo exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by one of the following means:\nBy email:\n \nfounders@getomni.ai\nYour data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA, short for the California Consumer Privacy Act. To find out more, visit the official\n \nCalifornia Legislative Information website\n.

This includes, in particular, your name, e-mail address and, if applicable, your address and telephone number as well as your IP address and online identifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision of the website\n\n\nPersonal data also includes information about your use of our website. In this context, we or our hosting provider collect the following personal data:\n\n\n\n\nYour IP address,\n\n\nyour internet service provider,\n\n\ndate and time of the request,\n\n\ncontent of the request,\n\n\naccess status/HTTP status code,\n\n\nscope of the data transfer,\n\n\nbrowser, operating system and its interface, language and version of browser software,\n\n\nas well as other connection data and sources that you retrieve.\n\n\n\n\nThis is usually done through the use of log files and cookies. You can find more information on cookies under point 2.\n\n\nWe use this data to protect our legitimate interests,\n\n\n\n\nto display the website on your computer,\n\n\nto ensure the functionality of the website,\n\n\nto optimise our website,\n\n\nto ensure the security of our information technology systems.\n\n\n\n\nAccess to this data is in accordance with \u00a7 25 para. 2 no. 1 TTDSG. The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCookies\n\n\n1.1\n \nGeneral information regarding cookies\n\n\nWe collect information about your use of our website through the use of cookies. A cookie usually contains the name of the website from which the cookie data is sent, information about the age of the cookie and an alphanumeric identifier (cookie ID). Cookies enable our systems to recognise your terminal device and to make any preferences immediately available. As soon as you access the website, a cookie is stored on your terminal device.\n\n\nOn our website, we use cookies that are absolutely necessary so that we can provide you with the website (hereinafter \u201cnecessary cookies\u201d). We set Necessary Cookies when you access the Website. The following Necessary Cookies are currently used on the website:\n\n\nName: wp-wpml_current_language\n\n\nPurpose: \nWordPress Multi Language for Ger\n\u2013\nman and English\n\n\nDuration: Unlimited\n\n\nWe use cookies that are absolutely necessary for the operation of the website in order to protect our legitimate interest in displaying the website on your terminal device and to save your cookie settings. The provision of the website or certain functions of the website would not be possible without the use of the necessary cookies. Access to this data is in accordance with \u00a7 25 para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG. The legal basis for the processing of the data collected with the help of necessary cookies is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.\n\n\nIn addition, we use cookies that are not absolutely necessary for the provision of the website (hereinafter \u201cconsent cookies\u201d). However, we only use consent cookies if and insofar as you have given your prior consent for this via the cookie banner. The cookie banner is displayed the first time you visit the website or when the period of your consent has expired. In the cookie banner you can give your consent separately for each consent cookie. However, if you do not give your consent for the use of all or individual consent cookies, we cannot guarantee that you will be able to use all the offers of the website without restriction or at all. You can revoke your consent to the use of consent cookies in whole or in part at any time by changing your cookie settings under the following link: Cookie Settings.\n\n\nAccess to the data collected with consent cookies is in accordance with \u00a7 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The legal basis for the use of the data obtained with the help of the consent cookies is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter\n\n\nOn the website, we offer you the opportunity to register for our newsletter so that we can send you information and news about us and our services at regular intervals by e-mail.\n\n\nThe newsletter will only be sent if you give us your consent to do so. You give your consent in two steps: First, you confirm that you would like to activate the newsletter by entering your e-mail address, ticking the box and then confirming that you would like to receive the newsletter. We will then send you an activation e-mail in which you click on a link to activate your e-mail address for receiving the newsletter. Only then will the newsletter be sent to your e-mail address.\n\n\nThe processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR with your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. To do so, click on the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link included at the end of each newsletter email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact form\n\n\nOn our website, we offer you the possibility to contact us via a contact form and to send us questions, suggestions or comments as well as to request information about our services.\n\n\nIf you use the contact form, your name, your business e-mail address and your company will be transmitted to us as mandatory data.\n\n\nIn addition, you can voluntarily provide further information about your request. We use this data exclusively to answer your enquiry and to send you information and advertising material if you have requested such. We use the voluntary information to address you personally.\n\n\nWe process your data to protect our legitimate interest in offering you modern and convenient ways to contact us. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Analytics\n\n\nWe use Google Analytics including the Universal Analytics features as well as the User ID feature a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland (\u201cGoogle\u201d).\n\n\nGoogle Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your device, to help analyse how users use the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. In the event that IP anonymisation is activated on the service, however, your IP address will be truncated beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of us, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the services, compiling reports on activity and providing other services relating to activity and internet usage to us. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. Universal Analytics also allows us to analyse the activities on the website across devices (e.g. access via laptop and later via tablet). This is made possible by the pseudonymous assignment of an ID to a user. Such an assignment takes place, for example, when you register for a user account with us or log in to your user account. However, no personal data is forwarded to Google. Even if additional functions are added to Google Analytics with Universal Analytics, this does not mean that a restriction of data protection measures such as IP masking or the browser add-on is associated with this. The use of the user ID function enables us to analyse interactions with you and other users on a person-specific basis. For this purpose, we provide the user accounts with an identifier that can only be assigned to the respective user account (\u201cUser ID\u201d). The User ID function processes users\u2019 personal data in order to optimise the website and to adapt them to users\u2019 needs.\n\n\nWe would like to point out that the code \u201cgat._anonymizeIp();\u201d has already been added to Google Analytics on the website in order to ensure that IP addresses are only recorded anonymously (so-called IP masking).\n\n\nWe also use Google Analytics to analyse data from ads and the Double-Click-Cookie for statistical purposes.\n\n\nFurther information on data protection at Google can be found at \nhttps://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de\n\n\nHowever, we only use Google Analytics, the functions of Universal Analytics and the User ID function if and insofar as you have given your prior consent for this via the cookie banner. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. The access to the information takes place in accordance with \u00a7 25 para. 1 p. 1 TTDSG.\n\n\nIf you wish to prevent the use of Google Analytics, the functions of Universal Analytics and the User ID function after granting the corresponding consent, you have the option of revoking your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time via the cookie settings on the website. However, we draw your attention to the fact that we cannot guarantee that you will be able to use all the functions of the website without restriction or at all if you do not give or revoke your consent to the use of Google Analytics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Ads \n\n\nWe use the online marketing tool Google Ads from Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland (hereinafter \u201cGoogle\u201d).\n\n\nGoogle Ads enables us to draw your attention to the website offered by us by means of advertisements. If you access the website via a Google ad, Google Ads sets a cookie on your end device.\n\n\nGoogle delivers the advertising material via so-called \u201cad servers\u201d and we use so-called ad server cookies, which are used to measure success. This provides us with information on the success of individual marketing measures. We do not use the ad server cookies to identify you. They are only stored as analysis values.\n\n\nIn addition, Google is able to recognise your browser through cookies set by Google. Through the use of Google Ads, Google receives the information that you have called up a part of our website or viewed an advertisement from us. If you are registered with Google, Google can assign your visit to our website to your account. If you do not have a Google account, Google can still recognise and store your IP address.\n\n\nBy using Google Ads, your browser establishes a connection with the Google servers. We ourself do not collect any personal data from you with the marketing measures, but only grant Google the opportunity to collect data. We then only receive statistical evaluations of which ads were clicked on; no other data is made available. We cannot identify users on the basis of the evaluations transmitted by Google.\n\n\nFurther information on data protection at Google can be found at \nhttps://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.\n\n\nWe only use Google Ads if and insofar as you have previously given your consent to this via the cookie banner. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. Access to the information takes place in accordance with \u00a7 25 para. 1 s. 1 TTDSG.\n\n\nIf you want to stop the use of Google Ads after giving your consent, you have the option to revoke your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time via the cookie settings on the website However, we draw your attention to the fact that we cannot guarantee that you will be able to use all the functions of the website without restriction or at all if you do not give or revoke your consent to the use of Google Ads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Ads\n\n\nWe use LinkedIn Ads for our marketing initiatives, provided by LinkedIn Corporation, 1000 W. Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA (\u201cLinkedIn\u201d).\n\n\nWhenever you visit our website, your browser establishes a direct connection with the LinkedIn servers. LinkedIn is based in the USA and the data processed by it is transferred to servers in the USA. Through this, LinkedIn is informed that you have visited our website from your IP address. If you click on a LinkedIn ad, LinkedIn can associate this information with your user account. We use LinkedIn Ads for marketing and optimization purposes, especially to place relevant and interesting ads, improve reporting on campaign performance and to avoid showing you the same ads multiple times.\n\n\nFor more information on LinkedIn\u2019s privacy policy and the LinkedIn Insight tag, please visit: \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.\n\n\nWe only use LinkedIn Ads if and insofar as you have previously given your consent to this via the cookie banner. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. Access to the information takes place in accordance with \u00a7 25 para. 1 s. 1 TTDSG.\n\n\nIf you want to stop the use of LinkedIn Ads after giving your consent, you have the option to revoke your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time via the cookie settings on the website. However, we draw your attention to the fact that we cannot guarantee that you will be able to use all the functions of the website without restriction or at all if you do not give or revoke your consent to the use of LinkedIn Ads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo transfer of personal data to third parties \n\n\nWe do not pass on your personal data to third parties unless you have consented to the passing on of data or the operator is entitled or obliged to pass on data due to legal provisions and/or official or court orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData security \n\n\nWe secure our website and other systems by technical and organisational measures against loss, destruction, access, modification or distribution of your data by unauthorised persons. These are adapted according to the current state of the art. In particular, all of our content is transmitted in encrypted form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErasure\n\n\nWe store your data for as long as we are entitled to do so. If you have exercised your right to object, or if the legal basis subsequently ceases to apply for another reason, in particular because the purpose for which the data was collected has been achieved, we will delete the data immediately, unless we are obliged to retain the data due to a legal obligation to retain it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData protection and websites of third parties\n\n\nOur website may contain hyperlinks to and from third party websites. If you follow a hyperlink to one of these websites, the operators of the linked website are responsible for the processing of your personal data on these websites. Please make sure you are aware of the applicable data protection conditions before submitting personal data to these websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour rights\n\n\nYou can access your personal data free of charge at any time and request information on its origin, recipients or categories of recipients to whom this data is passed on and the purpose of its storage and, if necessary, its correction and/or erasure and/or restriction of its processing. You also have the right to data portability.\n\n\nYou also have the right to object to the processing of your data at any time, provided that the processing is carried out to protect our legitimate interests. In this case, your data will only be processed if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that outweigh your interest in the exclusion of the processing or if the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend our claims.\n\n\nIf you have provided us with personal data, we will send it to you on request in machine-readable form for use by other providers.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, comments or requests regarding our collection, processing and use of your personal data or to exercise your rights as set out above, please contact us by email at \ninfo@happyops.com\n or by letter at our business address.\n\n\nIf you are concerned that the processing of your data violates data protection laws, you have the right to complain to us about this using the contact details provided.

By accessing our sites or providing us your information when you contact us, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.\nThis document focuses on information related to the use of all Beagle products and services, including \nwww.beagleservices.com\n and other products from Beagle (collectively, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeagle Products\u00e2\u0080\u009d). In this Privacy Statement, the expression \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeagle Products\u00e2\u0080\u009d also includes our Beagle Guarantee as defined in the Beagle Guarantee Terms and Conditions.\nWe provide additional details about how we collect and use information from our public web sites in our Privacy Policy for Beagle Websites.\nWe reserve the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time, so please review it periodically. We may notify you in the event we make changes to this Privacy Statement. If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement, you can contact Beagle by email at \nsupport@beagleservices.com\n or by telephone at \n+1 (424) 226 - 6101\n.\nOur Pledge\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n1. We will be transparent about the different types of information we collect and how we use them.\n2. We will use data responsibly. When using or sharing data with third parties, we'll generally do so for purposes of providing or enhancing Beagle Products, and when we think they will provide you with a welcome additional service. In certain circumstances, a third party (such as your home insurer, home warranty provider, or plumber) may pay for the Beagle Products, subsidize, discount or pay for part of the Beagle Products, and/or some or all of the Beagle Products (a \u00e2\u0080\u009cThird-Party Payer\u00e2\u0080\u009d). In that circumstance, you are deemed to have consented to permit Beagle to share data collected from the Beagle Products, including your personal information, with that Third-Party Payer.\n3. We will use industry standard data security tools to keep your data safe and protect the Beagle Products from unauthorized access. Beagle is committed to protecting the security of your personal information and data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect this information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.\nYour Consent\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nConsent to data collection and processing\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nBy using Beagle Products, you agree to allow us to collect and process information as described in this Privacy Statement. You acknowledge that monetizing data is part of Beagle's business model, and helps allow Beagle to provide the Beagle Products and Services; as such, you consent to Beagle using and monetizing your data.\nConsent to data export\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nYour personal information may be collected, processed and stored by Beagle or its service providers in the United States and other countries where our servers reside. Please be aware that the privacy protections and legal requirements, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, in some of these countries may not be equivalent to those in your country. If you are using Beagle Products in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from United States law, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to the United States and other countries where Beagle operates.\nWhat information does the Beagle Device collect?\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nThe Beagle Device may collect:\n\u00e2\u0088\u0099 Setup, account and on-boarding information you provide, or as provided by a third party, including but not limited to your name, email, password, home address, phone number, and other home plumbing or construction information.\n\u00e2\u0088\u0099 Data from third-party products that Beagle may install on your property, including but not limited to alarms, notifications, user preferences, settings, and user actions.\n\u00e2\u0088\u0099 Other data collected by Beagle via third party systems you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve authorized Beagle to collect.\nSetup information you provide\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nWhen you first use the Beagle Products, you may be asked several questions in order to help us create your user experience. For example, we mayl ask for information about your property type (i.e. a single family home), the number of occupants and size of the home, or your home address or postal/ZIP code, or other information about your home plumbing and/or construction. This information helps us to customize your experience to help protect your home. We will also collect information as you use the Beagle Product \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether by using the Beagle website, contacting customer support, or providing information to our employees.\nTechnical information from third party products\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIn order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with third party products, we may record the model numbers and serial numbers, software versions, and other technical information about internet of things products and plumbing fixtures or appliances at your property.\nHow does my Beagle information or account interact with third parties?\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nBeagle may use third parties to provide some services on its behalf. For example, Beagle may use third parties to host its websites, send you notifications, conduct surveys, or process transactions, among other services. Beagle may share information with third parties in order to deliver Beagle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services efficiently to you.\nTo perform certain services, track issues, improve our customer experience, and assist in analyzing how our Service is used, Beagle may use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.\nAdditional information about the limited circumstances in which information from your Beagle account may be shared with third parties is described below in the section titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn what circumstances does Beagle share my information?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAny Beagle data that you choose to share with a third party is governed by that third party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s privacy policy while in that party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possession. Although Beagle tries to link only to websites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other websites or third parties.\nAny data that Beagle receives from third-parties will be processed and stored by Beagle and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Statement. This information may be processed in the same ways as any other data that is a part of your Beagle account.\nBasic Customer Information\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nWhen you become a Beagle customer, we collect and store information which may include your name, phone number, address and/or email address. From that point forward, your information is used for communications from Beagle. In addition, Beagle may provide you with the ability to enable individuals to access your account as additional authorized users, or to invite other individuals such as friends or family to share access to your content. We will ask you for the email address of any such individuals and automatically send an email invitation on your behalf. Beagle stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation services. Names and other information may be shown to others in connection with the Services. For example, if you invite someone as an additional authorized user, he or she may be able to see your name.\nHow does Beagle use the information it collects?\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nWe may use this information to provide, develop and improve Beagle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products and services, including to make assessments and recommendations about products, safety, water use, water security, water damage prevention, or other related products and/or services. We may use your contact details to send you this information, or to ask you to participate in surveys about your Beagle use, and to send you other communications from Beagle.\nWe may also use this information in an aggregated, non-identified form for research purposes and to help us make sales, marketing, and business decisions.\nWe may use service providers to perform some of these functions. Those service providers are restricted from sharing your information for any other purpose.\nWe use industry-standard methods to keep this information safe and secure while it is transmitted over your home network and through the Internet to our servers. Depending on your location and type of data, Beagle may process your personal information on servers that are not in your home country. Although the laws that protect personal information in those countries may differ from the laws where you live, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By contacting us, using our Beagle Products, or using our Services, you consent to the transfer of the data outside of your country.\nIn what circumstances does Beagle share my information?\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nWe do not share personal information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the activation, enhancement, research, services and delivery of Beagle products and services without asking you first, except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Statement.\nThe following are the limited situations where we may share personal information:\n\u00e2\u0088\u0099 With your explicit consent:\nWe may share personal information when we have your consent. One example of this would be if you invite another person to interact with Beagle on your behalf. Another example is if you sign up for programs offered by our partners (e.g., water utility, home warranty or insurance companies); if you do this, we may share certain information with the partner. This could include things like your enrollment information, service data and the activation status of your device. Also, as described above, in certain circumstances, a Third-Party Payer (such as your home insurer) may pay for the installation of products by Beagle, in which case you are deemed to have consented to permit Beagle to share data collected from the Beagle Products, including your personal information, with that Third-Party Payer.\n\u00e2\u0088\u0099 For certain transactions:\nIn connection with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all of your personal information to commercial partners, insurers, financial institutions, government entities and shipping companies or postal services involved in fulfillment of the transaction without further notice to you. Disclosures may occur on an ongoing basis pursuant to Beagle's agreements with such commercial partners, insurers, financial institutions, government entities and shipping companies or postal services.\n\u00e2\u0088\u0099 For external processing:\nWe may use vendors, service providers, and technicians to help with some of our processing and storage, including helping to answer your questions. They may also assist with monitoring Beagle systems to facilitate our operations.\n\u00e2\u0088\u0099 As part of business transitions:\nCircumstances may arise where, for strategic or other business reasons, Beagle decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its businesses or commercial partnership. Such transactions may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of personal information from sellers. We may disclose information we maintain about you to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of Beagle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assets. Upon the completion of such a transaction, your personal information may be among the items sold or transferred. We will request a purchaser to treat our data under the privacy statement in place at the time of its collection.\n\u00e2\u0088\u0099 For legal reasons:\nWe may provide information to a third party if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so for legal reasons. For example, to respond to legal process, or comply with state and federal laws (or the applicable laws of foreign countries other than the United States).\nWe may share non-personal information (for example, aggregated or anonymized customer data) publicly and with our partners. For example, we may publish trends about adoption rates of smart home plumbing technology. This information may also be shared with other users to help them better understand different smart plumbing solutions in the Beagle community, raise awareness about safety or conservation issues, or help us generally improve our products and services. We may also share non-personal information with our partners. We will take steps to keep this non-personal information from being associated with you and we require our partners to do the same.\nAdditional Information Regarding Insurance Pilots:\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nYou may have agreed to participate in a pilot project between us and a third party involving the sharing of data collected by Beagle. In this case, Beagle and the insurance partner may have entered into an agreement in which Beagle will be providing to the insurance carrier, with your consent hereunder, data generated from your use of Beagle. By using Beagle through one of these pilots, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, accepted, agreed to be bound by and to comply with this Privacy Statement and the terms and conditions:\n1) You agree to allow the insurer to access your information. Such information may include, but not be limited to, personally identifiable information about you, your property, the functioning of the plumbing equipment in your property, and other data that might provide the insurer with information about the risks of future water leaks in your property (collectively hereafter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cData\u00e2\u0080\u009d). You agree and consent to allow us to license the Data to the insurer. Initially, the insurer may use the Data from the services offered by Beagle to the insurer. The use of the Data can be expanded into purposes, including underwriting/rating purposes, such as providing discounts to customers who enroll in an insurer's policy or discounting programs. Your consent to sharing the Data with the insurer is voluntary. Should you decide at any time to discontinue your participation in the sharing of Data with the insurer, you may do so by notifying Beagle of your intent to withdraw your consent.\n2) Except as described in this Policy, Beagle will not share your Data without first explicitly asking your permission, usually in the form of a web page or email requiring you to indicate your acceptance of the terms.\nDoes Beagle save my personal information?\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nBeagle stores your personal information on Beagle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servers in order to provide you with Beagle products and services. Personal information is encrypted as it is transmitted to Beagle and cannot easily be accessed. We may share, as described in this Privacy Statement, information with our affiliates and subsidiaries, and third parties. We may disclose information in response to legal process and lawful requests by public authorities in the United States and other countries for the purposes of law enforcement and national security. Please note that this Privacy Statement may change from time to time.

Additionally, as part of the registration process, you may choose to provide your YouTube channel, Steam ID, Twitter handle, Facebook page and/or Twitch id.\n\n\nWhen you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer\u2019s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.\n\n\nWith your permission, we may send you company news, information about our store, new products, promotions and other updates.\n\n\nSECTION 2 - CONSENT\n\n\nHow do you get my consent?\n\n\nWhen you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.\n\n\nIf we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.\n\n\nHow do I withdraw my consent?\n\n\nIf after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at PRIVACY@3BLACKDOT.COM or mailing us at: 3BD HOLDINGS, INC 717 MATEO STREET, LOS ANGELES, CA 90021, United States\n\n\nSECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE\n\n\nWe may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.\n\n\nSECTION 4 - SHOPIFY\n\n\nOur store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.\n\n\nYour data is stored through Shopify\u2019s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.\n\n\nPayment:\n\n\nIf you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.\n\n\nAll direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.\n\n\nPCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.\n\n\nFor more insight, you may also want to read Shopify\u2019s Terms of Service here or Privacy Statement https://www.shopify.com/legal.\n\n\nSECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES\n\n\nIn general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.\n\n\nHowever, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.\n\n\nFor these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.\n\n\nIn particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.\n\n\nAs an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.\n\n\nOnce you leave our store\u2019s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website\u2019s Terms of Service.\n\n\nLinks\n\n\nWhen you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.\n\n\nSECTION 6 - SECURITY\n\n\nTo protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.\n\n\nIf you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.\n\n\nCOOKIES\n\n\nHere is a list of cookies that we use. We\u2019ve listed them here so you that you can choose if you want to opt-out of cookies or not.\n\n\n_session_id, unique token, sessional, Allows Shopify to store information about your session (referrer, landing page, etc).\n\n\n_shopify_visit, no data held, Persistent for 30 minutes from the last visit, Used by our website provider\u2019s internal stats tracker to record the number of visits\n\n\n_shopify_uniq, no data held, expires midnight (relative to the visitor) of the next day, Counts the number of visits to a store by a single customer.\n\n\ncart, unique token, persistent for 2 weeks, Stores information about the contents of your cart.\n\n\n_secure_session_id, unique token, sessional\n\n\nstorefront_digest, unique token, indefinite If the shop has a password, this is used to determine if the current visitor has access.\n\n\nSECTION 7 - AGE OF CONSENT\n\n\nBy using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are the age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use this site.\n\n\nSECTION 8 - CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY\n\n\nWe reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.

These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual profits or financial results you may receive from your investment in a whiskey cask to be materially different from the future profits or financial results as expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. CaskX has attempted to identify these forwarding looking statements with the words \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201ccould\u201d and other similar expressions. Although these forward looking statements reflect our expectations related to your potential profits and financial results in connection with the investment in a whiskey cask, such forward looking statements are based on information now available to us, which is subject to change, and they are inherently subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties including, but are not limited to the following: the highly regulated nature of the whiskey industry and the requirements that may be imposed on you due to changes in law after you acquire your whiskey cask; changes in consumer and commercial demand for whiskey; loss of whiskey due to evaporation or failure to appropriately monitor the cask as it is maturing; loss of whiskey due to leakage, damage or theft, competition for the sale of whiskey with other investors or distilleries having greater resources than you; negative perception for the distillery who manufactured the whiskey in your cask or lack of brand loyalty; and lack of public market for whiskey casks and the requirement to hold your investment for quite some time due to the long maturation of whiskey and applicable United States securities laws. Please review our Notice to Investors and related Risk Factors for a further description of these and other factors you should consider before making an investment in whiskey casks. CaskX is under no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of publication for this website and associated documents to conform such statements to new information."

For purposes of this section, the term \u201c\npersonal information\n\u201d has the meaning given in the CCPA but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.  In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, such as job applicants, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.\nYour California privacy rights.\n California residents have the rights listed below under the CCPA. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.\nRight to information/know.\n You can request information about the categories of personal information that we have collected; the categories of sources from which we collected personal information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, sharing and/or selling personal information; the categories of any personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and the categories of any third parties with whom personal information was sold, shared or disclosed for a business purpose.\nRight to access.\n You can request a copy of the personal information that we have collected about you. \nRight to Deletion. \nYou can ask us to delete the personal information that we have collected from you.\nRight to correction. \nYou can request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we have collected about you.\nOpt-out of sales or sharing. \nYou can opt-out of any sale of your personal information or any \u201csharing\u201d of your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.\nOpt-in.\n If we know that you are 13-15 years of age, we will ask for your affirmative authorization to sell your Personal Information before we do so.\nNondiscrimination.\n You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination as prohibited by the CCPA. \nExercising your right to information/know, access, correction and deletion.\n You may submit requests to exercise your right to information by submitting a form \nhere\n, calling us toll free at 1-(866) 862-2645, or via email to \nsupport@flybyjing.com\n. The rights described above are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.\nVerification of identity.\n We may need to verify your identity in order to process your information/know, access, correction, or deletion requests and reserve the right to confirm your residency. To verify your identity, we may require government identification, a declaration under penalty of perjury, authentication into your Service account, personal identifiers we can match against information we may have collected from you previously, confirmation of your request using the email or telephone account stated in the request, or other information, where permitted by law.\nAuthorized agents. \nYour authorized agent may make a request on your behalf. However, we may need to verify your authorized agent\u2019s identity and authority to act on your behalf. We may require a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to applicable law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorized, such as by providing your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, the information we request to verify your identity, and confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.\nInformation practices. \nThe following describes our practices currently and during the past 12 months:\nSources and purposes.\n We collect all categories of personal information from the sources and use them for the business/commercial purposes described above in the Privacy Policy.\nSales and sharing of personal information.\n We do not \u201csell\u201d personal information as defined by the CCPA.  California law classifies our use of some of the services that help deliver interest-based ads to you as \u201csharing\u201d your personal information with the advertising partners that provide the services from which you have the right to opt-out.  You can request to opt-out of this \u201csharing\u201d of your personal information here: \nDo Not Share My Personal Information\n. Your request to opt-out will apply only to the browser and the device from which you submit the request.  You can broadcast the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to opt-out for each participating browser system that you use; learn more at the \nGlobal Privacy Control\n website.  We do not have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the personal information of California residents under 16 years of age.\nSensitive personal information. \nWe do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes that California residents have a right to limit under the CCPA.\nRetention.\n The criteria for deciding how long to retain personal information is generally based on whether such a period is sufficient to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it as described in this notice, including complying with our legal obligations.\nDe-identification. \nWe do not attempt to re-identify de-identified information derived from personal information, except for the purpose of testing whether our deidentification processes comply with applicable law.\nCollection and disclosure.\n The chart below describes the personal information we collect by reference to the categories of personal information specified in the CCPA (Cal. Civ. Code \u00a71798.140), and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it. The terms in the chart refer to the categories of information and third parties described above in this Privacy Policy in more detail. Information you voluntarily provide to us, such as in free-form webforms, may contain other categories of personal information not described below.

Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\n\n\nIn general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we use Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users, provide technical support, and inform users about promotional offers.\n\n\nWe may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud, security or technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.\n\n\nNon-Personal Information\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service, Apps, and customize the user experience.

YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes.

We may, from time to time, share personally identifiable information with other companies affiliated with us and unrelated third parties (e.g., retailers, marketers) to enable them to provide users with opportunities to learn of products or services in which they may be interested.

To request that we not share your information for such marketing purposes, you may e-mail us at \n[email\u00a0protected]\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCOOKIES & WEB BEACONS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo enhance your experience with the Site, many of our Web pages use \u201ccookies.\u201d Cookies are text files we place in your computer\u2019s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at the Site. However, once you choose to furnish the Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on the Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on the Site. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files, and only the website that transferred a particular cookie to you can read, modify or delete such cookie. You always have the option of disabling cookies using your browser preferences. Most browsers allow you to delete existing cookies, to automatically decline cookies or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of particular cookies to your computer. However, please be aware that some features of the Site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. We do not control cookies that you may occasionally get from third-party sites.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWeb beacons\u201d or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a Web page to monitor the behavior of and collect data about the visitors viewing a Web page. For example, Web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a Web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use Web beacons from third party Web analytics services on this Site from time to time for these and other purposes. The service does not collect personally identifiable information that you do not voluntarily enter in this Site.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCOLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SPONSORS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may, from time to time, offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties, including affiliated businesses. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties\u2019 use of this information. Since these third parties will use your information in accordance with their own privacy practices, you should check their websites for information regarding their privacy policies. We will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at our Web pages. These third-party ad servers may use cookies, Web beacons, clear .gifs, or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements\u2019 effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third-party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe and our advertisers may use third parties to serve or present the ads that appear on the Site and to conduct research about the advertisements. For more information about third-party ad servers, please visit: \nwww.networkadvertising.org\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLINKS TO OTHER SITES\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Site may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us and whose information practices may be different than ours. You should consult the other sites\u2019 privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to, maintain security of, and correctly use the information we collect. Personally identifiable information and account activity are also protected through the use of e-mail addresses and passwords. In order to maintain the security of your information, you should protect the confidentiality of such information used on the Site. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHOW YOU CAN ACCESS AND UPDATE INFORMATION\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf you have previously provided any personally identifiable information to us by way of the Site, you retain the right to review, correct, update, delete or otherwise modify such information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo access the personally identifiable information that we have collected about you that we maintain, or to correct factual errors in such information, you may contact us at the \u201cContact\u201d address or e-mail provided below.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL VISITORS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInformation we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States where our central database is operated. The privacy laws of the U.S. may not be as comprehensive as the data protection laws of the European Union and elsewhere. Please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected and implement necessary measures on an ongoing basis to keep your personal information secure. By providing us with your personally identifiable information, you consent to its use in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including the transfer of personally identifiable information relating to you to our computer systems in the United States.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPRIVACY POLICY FOR MINORS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn compliance with state and federal laws, we do not collect personal information about or from minors under the age of 21 except in limited circumstances authorized by law and described in this Privacy Policy.

Unless required by law, none of the information will be used for another purpose or shared with third parties, nor will personally identifying information be published on the Site.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrom time to time, we reserve the right to make updates to this Privacy Policy without prior notice to you. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this Privacy Policy so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it.

We will note the date of the latest revision of our Privacy Policy at the top of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Platform following posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollection of Personal Data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Data You Provide to Us\n.

All payment processing services connected with your use of the Platform are provided to you by our third-party payment processors.

We may obtain personal data about you from third parties, such as social media platforms, service providers, advertising partners, data analytics partners, event sponsors, publicly available sources, or data providers. We may merge or combine such personal data with the personal data we collect from you directly or automatically.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Data Collected Automatically\n. We, our service providers, and our advertising partners may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your activity over time on our Platform and other websites and online services, such as:\n\n\n\n\n\nDevice Data\n, such as your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, IP address, unique identifiers, the website you visited before browsing to our website, and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.\n\n\n\n\nOnline Activity Data\n, such as login frequency, pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and duration of access.\n\n\n\n\nLike many online services, we use the following technologies to facilitate some of our automatic data collection:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCookies\n, which are text files that websites store on a visitor\u2018s device to uniquely identify the visitor\u2019s browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand user activity and patterns, and facilitating online advertising.\n\n\n\n\nWeb Beacons\n, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are typically used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked, typically to compile statistics about usage of websites and the success of marketing campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nSession replay technologies\n, which are third-party software used to record a video replay of users\u2019 interactions with the Platform. The video replay may include users\u2019 clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, mobile app touches, typing, and other activity taken during the session. We use these replays for research and development purposes, such as to help us troubleshoot problems with the Platform, understand how users interact with and use the Platform, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Data about Others\n. Users of the Platform may have the opportunity to refer other contacts or us.

We use personal data for research and development purposes, including to extract, compile, synthesize, and analyze the usage data, analytics, statistics, and other information and preferences of our users to make our Platform and other offerings better, and to develop new features, services, products, and functionality. As part of these activities, we may create aggregated, de-identified, or other anonymous data from personal data we collect.

We may use this anonymous data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes.\n\n\n\n\nFor Marketing and Advertising\n.

To do this, follow the instructions in your browser\u2019s settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings.

In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for targeted online advertising purposes. If you opt-out of interest-based advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you.\n\nSome of the third party advertising companies we work with offer their own opt-out options that you can use to limit their use of your information for interest-based advertising, such as Google (\ninfo\n and \nopt-out\n) and Facebook (\ninfo\n and \nopt-out\n). Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms or do not participate in the opt-out mechanisms described above. Even after using these opt-out mechanisms, you may receive interest-based advertising from other companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Not Track\n.

While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal data from the risks presented by unauthorized access or acquisition, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sites And Services.\n\n\nThe Platform may contain links to other websites and online services operated by third parties.

Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal data. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites and online services you use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Transfers of Personal Data.\n\n\nWe are based in the United States of America, and we have service providers in the United States and potentially other countries. Your personal data may be collected, used, stored, and transferred in these countries or other locations outside of your home country.

[www.responsibility.org]\n\n\n\n\nInformation Voluntarily Provided by You\n\n\n\n\nWe may collect information that our visitors volunteer to us, including but not limited to name, date of birth, postal address, e-mail address, telephone numbers, cell phone numbers, gender, household information, consumption habits, product usage, attitudes and preferences regarding our products and other personal information (collectively, \u201cPersonal Information\u201d). Any Personal Information you send us will be used for the purpose indicated on the Site or as stated in this policy.\n\n\n\n\nUse of Personal Information\n\n\n\n\nThis Personal Information will be held by LSF and may be used by LSF and its affiliated companies and their agents, partners, or licensees. We will not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute your Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties without your consent, except to the extent required by law, or as set out below:\n\n\n\n\nAgents and Service Providers. We sometimes contract with other companies and individuals to perform functions or services on our behalf.

We may also disclose information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.\n\n\n\n\nThe Personal Information we receive will be used in our marketing, promotion and advertising of the Brand. As a result of providing us with your contact information, we may contact you by sending you mailings or other communications (electronic or otherwise) regarding the Brand\u2019s products, services, promotions, or upcoming events that we believe may be of interest to you. We may also ask you (or have a service provider ask on your behalf) to participate in a survey seeking information or opinions related to our category of products.\n\n\n\n\nCookies and Other Forms of Data Collection\n\n\n\n\nWhen you visit our website or use our mobile applications, we collect certain Transaction Information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs and web beacons.\n\n\n\n\nCookies\n\n\n\n\nWhen you visit our website, we place cookies on your device. Cookies are small text files that websites send to your device or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return. They also help us provide a customized experience and enable us to detect certain kinds of fraud. In many cases, you can manage cookie preferences and opt-out of having cookies and other data collection technologies used by adjusting the settings on your browser. All browsers are different, so visit the \u201chelp\u201d section of your browser to learn about cookie preferences and other privacy settings that may be available.\n\n\n\n\nFlash Cookies\n\n\n\n\nWe may use Flash Cookies (also known as Local Stored Objects) and similar technologies to personalize and enhance your online experience. The Adobe Flash Player is an application that allows rapid development of dynamic content, such as video clips and animation. We use Flash cookies for security purposes and to help remember settings and preferences similar to browser cookies, but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. To manage Flash cookies, please see Adobe\u2019s website at http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html\n\n\nor visit www.adobe.com.\n\n\n\n\nPixel Tags and Web Beacons\n\n\n\n\nWe and our service providers may also use so-called \u201cpixel tags,\u201d \u201cweb beacons,\u201d \u201cclear GIFs\u201d or similar means (collectively, \u201cPixel Tags\u201d) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1\u00d71), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the visitors\u2019 hard drives. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTypes of Data We Collect\n\n\n\n\nWe collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information about the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. Our server logs also record the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to LSF and the website you visit after you leave our site.\n\n\n\n\nIn many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is only used in an aggregated or non-identifiable way, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about all website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns.\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, we do associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your Personal Information. This Privacy Statement governs how we use this information when we associate it with your Personal Information.\n\n\n\n\nThird Party Advertisers and Interest-Based Ads\n\n\n\n\nLSF has relationships with Google and other third party advertising companies to deliver interest-based advertisements, targeted to you based on your demographics, brand preferences, online behavior and similar factors. These companies may also perform tracking and reporting functions for us on this website and other websites. These companies may place cookies on your device when you visit our website or other websites so that they can display targeted advertisements to you. These companies do not collect Personal Information in this process, and we do not give any personal information to them as part of this process. However, this Privacy Statement does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by these companies.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about third party advertising, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) at www.aboutads.info/consumers. LSF complies with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as administered by the DAA. To opt out of being targeted by some third party advertising companies, you may visit www.aboutads.info/choices.\n\n\n\n\nWhile LSF does provide the ability to opt-out of certain targeting advertising as described in this Privacy Statement, we do not respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d (a/k/a DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. To learn more about browser tracking signals and Do Not Track please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.org/.\n\n\n\n\nE-mails to Friends\n\n\n\n\nIn the event that we offer the functionality to permit you to send messages regarding Site-related content to a friend through the Site, you may provide us with your friend\u2019s e-mail address so that we can facilitate your sending a message to your friend; provided, however, that we reserve the right to refuse to facilitate the message for any reason, including without limitation restrictions placed on this functionality by your jurisdiction or that of your friend. LSF may retain your friend\u2019s email address but will use your friend\u2019s address only as described in this Privacy Policy and will not send additional promotional messages to your friend unless your friend registers with us (or has registered previously). Please note that any personal data you provide in connection with your request to send messages to your friend may be disclosed to your friend.\n\n\n\n\nBy using our send-to-a-friend functionality, you confirm that all friends you nominate to receive messages are of legal drinking age in the country where they reside and that they have consented to receiving the email(s) from this Site that you request us to send.\n\n\n\n\nPromotions\n\n\n\n\nWe may have promotions or sweepstakes on our Site. When you enter a promotion or sweepstakes, we will ask for Personal Information about you. We will use this information for the purposes of administering the promotion or sweepstakes. We will also use and store this information for the purposes set forth under \u201cUse of Personal Information\u201d above unless you instruct us otherwise either through mechanisms provided with the entry form or by contacting us. Any additional uses for this information will be set forth in the Official Rules of the promotion.\n\n\n\n\nInformation Posted by Visitors\n\n\n\n\nLSF may make available through the Site services such as message boards to which you are able to post information, photos, images and other materials. Please note that any information, photos, images or materials you disclose through such services or otherwise on the Site becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Site all over the world and to the general public. In addition, when you choose to make a posting on such services, certain personal data will be available for other users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose personal data, or any other information, on the Site. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PERSONAL DATA YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE SITE.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, please recognize that the individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant\u2019s opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting our opinion.\n\n\n\n\nThird-Party Websites\n\n\n\n\nThe Site may contain links to third-party websites. These linked websites are not under LSF\u2019s control, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked website or any link contained in any linked website. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the website does not imply endorsement of the linked website by LSF. If you provide any personal data through any such third-party website, your transaction will occur on the third party\u2019s website (not this Site) and the personal data you provide will be collected by and controlled by the privacy policy of that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any third parties. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES.\n\n\n\n\nYour Information and Opting-Out\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not want to receive further communications from the Brand, please send a written request to the postal or e-mail address set out in this Privacy Policy or follow the opt-out instructions in the e-mail you receive from us. Please specify the means of communication from which you would like to opt-out. Otherwise, you may not get communications you would otherwise expect to receive from us.

Once you leave our servers (you can usually tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting (unless otherwise stated). That policy may differ from ours. If you can\u2019t find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site\u2019s homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.\n\n\n\n\nInformation Storage and Security\n\n\n\n\nThis Site and all information that you submit through this Site is collected, stored, and processed in the United States. We use reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. However, regardless of the effectiveness of our security measures, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We ask that you do your part by, at a minimum, keeping any computer passwords you use to access the Internet or this Site strictly confidential.\n\n\n\n\nInformation Related to Employment\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose to submit your resume or apply for a position with us through this Site, we will use (and transfer, if necessary) the information you provide in order to evaluate your experience as it relates to potential employment opportunities with LSF or our affiliated companies throughout the world. We will use the information to contact you regarding any positions for which we believe you may be interested in submitting an application or other opportunities at LSF or our affiliates that we think may interest you.\n\n\n\n\nContact Information\n\n\n\n\nQuestions regarding this policy should be directed to 898 W. 18th Street Costa Mesa, CA 92627, USA, online via email at hello@lossundays.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s Drink About It.\n\n\n\n          SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER FOR updates, access to exclusive deals, and more.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            FOLLOW ALONG \n \n@LOS_SUNDAYS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Account\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Contact\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Shipping / Returns\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Privacy / Terms\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              CCPA / GDPR\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Accessibility\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Facebook\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Vimeo\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Pinterest\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a9 2025 L\u00f8s Sundays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Account\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Contact\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Privacy / Terms\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              CCPA / GDPR\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Accessibility\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Facebook\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Shipping / Returns\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Pinterest\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n copyright 2025 L\u00f8s Sundays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n FOLLOW ALONG \n \n@LOS_SUNDAYS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Home\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shop Merch\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shop Tequila \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shop Seltzer\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Our Process\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Find Us\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Make Drinks"

How We Use the Information We Collect\n\n\nWe use the information we collect about you in the following ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo populate the Platform. We use your username and other information you choose to disclose to other users of the Platform to let them know about you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo communicate with you. We use the contact information you provide to communicate with you, send news, service, and promotional information, and respond to your inquiries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor administrative purposes. We use your information to process your transactions, provide customer service, and assist you with inquiries about our services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor marketing purposes. We use your information for marketing purposes including, but not limited to, notifying you of special promotions, offers, and events via email, direct mail, social media, and other means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo improve our Platform. The information we collect helps us customize content on the Platform, facilitate access to our Platform, and recognize a computer or device that has visited our Platform before. It also helps us detect potential problems on the Platform, analyze the functionality of the Platform, and improve the user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor data analytics purposes. We combine information about the users of our Platform to produce aggregated statistical information that helps us understand the frequency of visits to the Platform, the pages visited, and the features accessed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor legal purposes. We also use the information we collect where necessary to protect against, and identify, fraud and other prohibited activity, to comply with law or a legal obligation to which we are subject, or to exercise or defend legal claims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. How We Share the Information We Collect\n\n\nWe may share the information we collect:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our contractors, agents, or business partners so that they may perform services for us, which may include supporting the Platform, sending communications for us, executing marketing programs and promotions, and processing payments. We do not authorize these service providers to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our affiliates for purposes of supporting our business operations, which may include legal and administrative support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith other third parties, such as law enforcement or other government entities: (1) if we believe there has been a violation of the Terms of Use or other Platform policies; (2) if we believe that someone may be causing injury to our rights or property, other users, or anyone else; (3) to respond to judicial process or to provide information to law enforcement; or (4) as required by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the event of a sale or restructuring of the business, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of all or a portion of the company\u2019s assets. In such an event, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure the transferee uses your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Our Use of Cookies\n\n\nWe and our third-party service providers set and use cookies and similar technologies to store and manage user preferences, enable content, gather analytic and usage data, and deliver targeted advertising. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on a computer or other device and is used to identify the device and to collect information. Cookies are typically assigned to one of the following categories, depending on their function and intended purpose:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential cookies enable you to navigate the Platform and to use its services and features. Without these cookies, the Platform will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like, and we may not be able to provide certain core functions and features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytics cookies collect information about the use of the Platform and enable us to improve the way it works. For example, analytics cookies show us the most frequently visited pages and analyze site traffic. We use them to look at overall patterns of usage on our Website, rather than the usage of any particular individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use third-party service providers, including Google Analytics, to analyze use of the Platform. You can prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics at any time either by either downloading and installing a browser plug-in offered by Google or by configuring your browser to delete and reject cookies. You can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media cookies collect information about your use of the Platform, but only when you are logged in to your social media account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer interaction cookies allow us to communicate with you, including real-time communication, such as through any chat feature we may offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing cookies track browsing habits and are used to deliver targeted (interest-based) advertising. You can opt out of receiving interest-based ads for web properties here (Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s WebChoices).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost browsers are set up to accept cookies automatically. You can deactivate the storing of cookies or adjust your browser to inform you before the cookie is stored on your computer. Some browsers have \u201cdo not track\u201d features that allow you to tell a platform not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals.\n\n\n5. Third Party Social Media Platforms\n\n\nWe use social media accounts such as those on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn to engage with the public. Our social media accounts are produced and maintained by our communications department, sometimes working with service providers. Through our social media engagement, we are able to build online awareness about our company and our services, respond to messages through the comment, message, or chat functions, collect aggregated information about interactions with our content on or through social media, and analyze trends. When you engage with us through our social media channels, the platform providers will also process information about you. For further information, please consult the privacy policy of the respective platform provider.\n\n\n\n\n6. Your Choices and Communication Preferences\n\n\nYou can modify the information you have given us. To correct or delete information or update account settings, log into your account and follow the instructions. If action is required by us, we will make changes as soon as we can. This information may stay in our backup files. If we cannot make the changes you want, we will let you know and explain why.\n\n\nYou can control settings on your mobile device. For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your device.\n\n\nTo stop receiving our promotional emails, email us at privacy@Riff Raff.com with specific instructions to stop sending you our promotional emails or follow the instructions in any marketing email you get from us. It may take about ten days to process your request. Even if you opt out of getting marketing emails, we will still send you transactional messages. For example, we may still contact you about changes you make to your account.\n\n\n\n\n7. Children\n\n\nWe do not knowingly collect the personal information of children under the age of 13. The Platform is not directed to or intended for use by children under the age of 13. If we learn that a person under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us or that we otherwise have collected such information, we will delete it.\n\n\n\n\n8. Links to Third Party Sites\n\n\nFrom time to time, we may provide links to unaffiliated third-party platforms. Those platforms operate independently from us and our affiliates and may have their own privacy policies in place which we recommend you review if you visit any linked platforms. The ability to access information of third parties from our Platform, or links to other websites, locations, products, services, or other platforms is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such third parties, their services, other platforms, locations, or their contents.\n\n\n\n\n9. Security\n\n\nWe recognize the importance of maintaining the security of your information. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. Please be aware though that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We recommend that you help us keep your data safe by taking reasonable steps such as keeping your password private and not disclosing sensitive personal data in places that can be accessed by other users or the public.\n\n\n\n\n10. EEA and UK Residents\n\n\nWe store personal data for different periods of time consistent with the purposes for which they were originally collected, as subsequently further authorized, or when required or allowed under applicable law.\n\n\nEEA and UK residents have certain data subject rights which may be subject to limitations and/or restrictions. These rights may include the right to: (i) request access to and rectification or erasure of their personal data; (ii) obtain restriction of processing or to object to processing of their personal data; and (iii) the right to data portability. If you are an EEA or UK resident and wish to exercise one of the above-mentioned rights, please send us your request via email to \ninfo@riffraff.app\n and reference \u201cGDPR\u201d in the subject line.\n\n\nIf you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so that our records may be updated or corrected. You may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes applicable law. If you would like to contact our privacy protection representative, please contact us via email to privacy@Riff Raff.com and reference \u201cGDPR\u201d in the subject line.\n\n\nWe will respond to your request without undue delay. We will respond to your request within 30 days except that we may extend such 30-day period for two additional months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. We will let you know of any such extension within one month of receipt of your request, together with the reasons for the delay.\n\n\n\n\n11. California Residents\n\n\nIf you reside in California, you have the following rights under the CCPA:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: You have the right to request a report showing the personal information collected, shared, and sold about you in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeletion: You have the right to request that we delete any personal information collected from you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination: We shall not discriminate against you based on your exercise of any of the above rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make a request regarding any of these rights, please send us your request via email to \ninfo@riffraff.app\n and reference \u201cCCPA\u201d in the subject line. Please indicate in your communication that you are a California resident and include your full name and the type of request you are making. Depending on the sensitivity of the information requested and the type of request, we may require certain information to verify your identity before responding to your request. We will respond to your request within 45 days if possible and required under the law.\n\n\nThe metrics below indicate the number of requests we received to know, access, or delete information pursuant to the CCPA within the preceding 12 months:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequests to know: 0 total requests were received, 0 were complied with in whole or in part with an average completion time of 0 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequests to access: 0 total requests were received, 0 were complied with in whole or in part with an average completion time of 0 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequests to delete: 0 total requests were received, 0 were complied with in whole or in part with an average completion time of 0 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.

This Privacy Policy supplements other policies we may provide as part of our interactions with you or policies you may have received from other controllers and is not intended to override such policies.\nThis Privacy Policy is provided in a layered format.\u00a0\nThe Data We Collect About You\nHow We Collect Your Data\nHow We Use Your Data\nSharing Your Data with Third Parties\nInternational Transfers\nData Security\nData Retention\nYour Rights\nAccessibility\nContact Details\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\u00a0\nThe Data We Collect About You\n\u00a0\nThe following table explains what types of Personal Data we may collect:\n\u2022 User Data\n includes your first and last name.

For example, we may aggregate your Activity Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature available through the Website.\nProtecting the Privacy Rights of Third Parties\nIf you provide to us any Personal Data relating to others, you must make sure that you have permission to do so.\u00a0\n \nHow We Collect Your Data\n\u00a0\nWe use different methods to collect data from and about you, including through:\u00a0\n\u2022  Direct interactions\n.

Legitimate interest means our interest in managing and conducting our business.\u00a0\n\u2022  \nWhere the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation.\n\u2022  \nWhere you have provided your consent for such processing. Such consent can be revoked at any time.\u00a0\nPurposes for Which We Use Your Data\n\u00a0\u00a0\nBelow is a description of the ways we use your Personal Data. To the extent that the GDPR and/or UK GDPR apply, we have mentioned the legal bases we rely on to use your Personal Data, and identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate:\u00a0\n\u2022  \nWe use your User Data, Contact Data, Business Data, County Data and/or Candidate Data to enter into a contract or to perform a contract with you.

We do so for the performance of a contract with you, if it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or if it is necessary for our legitimate interests.\n\u2022  \nWe use your Usage Data, Technical Data, Country Data and Contact Data for marketing purposes, to deliver relevant and personalized content to you, send service messages (for example, for security purposes) and to measure or understand the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We do so where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (to grow our business, to inform our marketing strategy and to maintain and secure the services); or if we have obtained your prior consent (where laws require consent for such communications).\u00a0\n\u2022  \nWe use your Usage Data and Technical Data to improve our Website, services, marketing, customer relationships and experiences, including by personalizing and customizing our content. We do so where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (to keep our Website updated and relevant, to develop our business and to inform our marketing strategy).\n\u2022  \nWe use your Candidate Data to consider your application for career opportunities at Ludeo. We do so where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (recruitment of personnel and handling career applications) and to take steps prior to entering a contract with you.\n\u2022  \nIn the event of a legal dispute between you (and/or a party on your behalf) to us (and/or a party on our behalf), we may use your Personal Data to the extent necessary in connection with handling such dispute.

A cookie is a small piece of data or a text file that is downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you access certain websites. Cookies may contain text that can be read by the web server that delivered the cookie to you. The text contained in the cookie generally consists of a sequence of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies your computer or mobile device; it may contain other information as well. We and third parties we partner with may store, and access some or all the cookies described below on your device.\nTypes of cookies:\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2022  Strictly Necessary Cookies\n. These cookies are necessary for proper functioning of the Website, such as displaying content, logging in, validating your session, responding to your request for services, and other functions.\u00a0\n\u2022  Performance Cookies\n. These cookies collect information about the use of the Website, such as pages visited, traffic sources, users\u2019 interests, content management, and other measurements.\n\u2022  Functional Cookies\n. These cookies enable the Website to remember a user\u2019s choices \u2013 such as their language, user name, and other personal choices \u2013 while using the Website. They can also be used to deliver services, such as letting a user listen to audio or watch videos on the Website.\n\u2022  Media Cookies\n. These cookies can be used to improve the performance of the Website and provide special features and content. They can be placed by third parties who provide services to us or by our company.\n\u2022  Advertising or Targeting Cookies\n. These cookies can be used by Ludeo to develop a profile of your browsing interests and serve advertisements on other websites that are related to your interests.\u00a0\n\u2022  Session Cookies\n. These cookies allow us to link the actions of a user during a browser session. Session cookies permit users to be recognized as they navigate a website so that any item or page changes they make are remembered from page to page. Session cookies expire after a browser session; thus, they are not stored long term.\n\u2022  Persistent Cookies\n. These cookies are stored on a user\u2019s device in between browser sessions, which allows the user\u2019s preferences or actions across a site (or, in some cases, across different sites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes, including remembering users\u2019 choices and preferences when using a website or to target advertising to them.\nMost web browsers can be set to disable the use of cookies. However, if you disable cookies, you may not be able to access features on the Website correctly or at all. Further details on how to disable cookies in different web browsers can be found here:\nInternet Explorer:\u00a0\nhttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/internet-explorer/delete-manage-cookies\nGoogle Chrome:\u00a0\nhttps://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en\nMozilla Firefox:\u00a0 \nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer#w_cookie-settings\n\u00a0\nSafari:\u00a0\nhttp://help.apple.com/safari/mac/8.0/#/sfri11471\nMicrosoft edge: \nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-and-manage-cookies-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d\nOpera: \nhttps://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/\nWe may also use a technology called web beacons to collect general information about your use of our Platform and your use of special promotions or newsletters. The information we collect by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor the number of people who open our emails. Web beacons also help us to understand the behavior of our customers, members, and visitors.\u00a0\nThird parties may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from the Website and elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads.\u00a0\nThird-Party Links\n\u00a0\nThe Website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or interacting with such content may allow your data to be shared with the relevant third-party. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements; we therefore recommend that you read the privacy policy of every website you visit.\nSharing Your Data with Third Parties\nWe share Personal Data with third party service providers that provide us services in connection with the purposes listed above. For example, we use cloud storage providers for hosting the Website, third party analytical tools to analyze traffic and user engagement and to improve the Website, and additional external services for moderation, comments, operation, maintenance, optimization and support of the Website, etc. We may also share Personal Data providers of career application management platforms (like Comeet) in the context of your career application. These companies are authorized to use your Personal Data as necessary to provide these services or as otherwise authorized by us. Comeet\u2019s privacy policy is available \nhere\n.\nFor example, we may share your applicable User Data, Contact Data, Usage Data and Technical Data, with web analytics providers, email and marketing service providers and other vendors that assist us in maintaining the Website. For additional information, please see the description above in the section titled Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.\u00a0\nIf your Candidate Data is submitted to Ludeo by a third-party (such as an employee of Ludeo or a recruiting agency), Ludeo can give the third-party access to your name, photo and your general recruitment status. If you apply to a job opening using a unique referral link that was provided to you by an employee of Ludeo, Ludeo may share some of your general recruitment status, without identifying you by name, with the person that provided you the referral link. The purpose of sharing the above information is to operate incentive programs (i.e. employee referral bonus programs) of Ludeo and to provide feedback to third-parties who submit candidates to Ludeo regarding their submission.\u00a0\nWe may also share your Personal Data with legal and regulatory authorities to the extent required by applicable law with our professional advisors (e.g. lawyers, accountants) to the extent necessary for the provision of their services to us; and third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge our business (or parts thereof) or our assets, or parties whose business we wish to acquire.\u00a0\nInternational Transfers\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWe may transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the country in which you reside (including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK)), that do not necessarily provide the same level of data protection as the country in which you reside and are not recognized by the European Commission and/or the applicable UK authority as providing an adequate level of data protection.\nOur transfers of Personal Data outside of the EEA or the UK are done for the performance of a contract or implementation of pre-contractual relations with you, based on your consent, or subject to safeguards that ensure the protection of your Personal Data, such as standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission and/or the applicable UK authority.\nData Security\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWe have put in place security measures to prevent your Personal Data from accidental or unlawful loss, use, alteration or disclosure. We also maintain technical and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Data.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, we cannot guarantee against the loss or misuse of your Personal Data or secure data transmission over the Internet because of its nature.\nData Retention\n\u00a0\nWe retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for.\u00a0\nIn order to determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the following criteria: the volume, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of Personal Data, the purposes for which we collect and process Personal Data, the time frame during which we may require such Personal Data in connection with potential litigation, and applicable legal requirements.\nYour Rights\nCertain privacy laws, including the GDPR and/or UK GDPR, provide users with rights related to their Personal Data. To the extent that such laws apply to your Personal Data, you may have the following rights:\n\u2022  Request access\n. This means that you may receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you.\n\u2022  Request correction\n. This means that you may ask us to correct or complete inaccurate or incomplete data that we hold about you.\u00a0\n\u2022  Request erasure\n. This means that you may ask us to delete or remove Personal Data that we hold about you. If we are unable to comply with such a request, we will notify you of the specific legal reasons for our decision.\u00a0\n\u2022  Object to processing\n. This means that you may object to the processing of your Personal Data where it is used for direct marketing purposes, or where we are relying on a legitimate interest and you feel that such interest is overridden by your rights and freedoms.\n\u2022  Request restriction of processing\n. This means that you may ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data if you believe that such data is inaccurate, if our processing is unlawful or if we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose, but you need us to continue to hold the data.\n\u2022  Data Portability. \nThis means that you may request that we transfer your Personal Data to you or to a third party. This right applies where we have obtained and processed the data from you based on your consent or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.\n\u2022  Withdraw consent at any time. \nThis means that you may withdraw your consent where we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent.\nIf you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the contact details below.\u00a0\nWhat We May Need From You\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you approach us with a request to exercise one of your rights, we may request that you provide us with information needed to confirm your identity as a security measure to ensure that your Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\u00a0\nTime Limit to Respond\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month or less, if required by law. Where it takes us more than one month to respond (for example, where your request is particularly complicated or where you have made a number of requests) we will notify you and keep you updated.\nAccessibility\nIf you have a disability and would like to access this policy in an alternative format, please contact us via our contact details listed below.\nContact Details\n\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at:\u00a0\nEmail: \nprivacy@ludeo.com\nYou have the right to make a complaint at any time to data protection authorities. We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach a data protection authority, so please contact us in the first instance.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n\u00a0\nWe reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we do so, we will post an updated version of this Privacy Policy so that our users are aware of what information we collect, use, and disclose. Your continued use of the Website after any change to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.\nThis version was last updated on Oct 15, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n \nTerms\u00a0of Use\n \nSDK Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Ludeo All Rights Reserved."

HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?\nIn Short:\u00a0\nWe keep your information for as long as necessary to \nfulfill\n the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.\nWe will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or \nanonymize\n such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?\nIn Short:\u00a0\nWe aim to protect your personal information through a system of \norganizational\n and technical security measures.\nWe have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and \norganizational\n security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other \nunauthorized\n third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.\n9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?\nIn Short:\n\u00a0We do not knowingly collect data from or market to \nchildren under 18 years of age\n.\nWe do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent\u2019s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at \nhello@heythera.io\n.\n10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?\nIn Short:\n\u00a0\nDepending on your state of residence in the US or in \nsome regions, such as \nCanada\n, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information.\n\u00a0\nYou may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.\nIn some regions (like \nCanada\n), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section \n\"\nHOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?\n\"\n below.\nWe will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.\nWithdrawing your consent:\n If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,\n which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law,\n you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section \n\"\nHOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?\n\"\n below\n.\nHowever, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor,\n when applicable law allows,\n will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.\nOpting out of marketing and promotional communications:\n\u00a0\nYou can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by\n clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send,\n or by contacting us using the details provided in the section \n\"\nHOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?\n\"\n below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you \u2014 for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.\nCookies and similar technologies:\n Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. \nIf you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at \nhello@heythera.io\n.\n11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES\nMost web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (\n\"DNT\"\n) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for \nrecognizing\n and implementing DNT signals has been \nfinalized\n. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.\nCalifornia law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for \nrecognizing\n or \nhonoring\n DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.\n12.

DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?\n\n\nIn Short: We offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies.\n\n\nAs part of our Services, we offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies (collectively, \u201cAI Products\u201d). These tools are designed to enhance your experience and provide you with innovative solutions. The terms in this Privacy Notice govern your use of the AI Products within our Services.\n\n\nUse of AI Technologies\n\n\nWe provide the AI Products through third-party service providers (\u201cAI Service Providers\u201d), including Google Cloud AI. As outlined in this Privacy Notice, your input and output data, metadata, and personal information may be shared with and processed by these AI Service Providers to enable your use of our AI Products for purposes outlined in \u201cHOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?\u201d and \u201cWHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?\u201d. Your personal and business data and audio files are only used to provide Songbird services, as described in this policy, and are never sold to any other third party. You must not use the AI Products in any way that violates the terms or policies of any AI Service Provider.\n\n\nOur AI Products\n\n\nOur AI Products are designed for the following functions:\n\n\n\n\nAI predictive analytics\n\n\nMachine learning models\n\n\n\n\nHow We Process Your Data Using AI\n\n\nAll personal information processed using our AI Products is handled in line with our Privacy Notice and our agreement with third parties. This ensures high security and safeguards your personal information throughout the process, giving you peace of mind about your data\u2019s safety.\n\n\n6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?\n\n\nIf you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.\n\n\nOur Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Google logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.\n\n\nWe will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.\n\n\n7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?\n\n\nIn Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.\n\n\nWe will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than two (2) months past the termination of the user\u2019s account \nunless required by law\n.\n\n\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information. When we delete your data we also delete any backups.\n\n\n8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?\n\n\nWe aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.\n\n\nWe have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.\n\n\n9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?\n\n\nWe do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.\n\n\nWe do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent\u2019s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at \nprivacy@unbias.co\n.\n\n\n10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?\n\n\nIn Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.\n\n\nWithdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section \u201cHOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?\u201d below.\n\n\nHowever, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.\n\n\nOpting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section \u201cHOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?\u201d below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you \u2014 for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.\n\n\nAccount Information\n\n\nIf you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:\n\n\n\n\nLog in to your account settings and update your user account.\n\n\nContact us using the contact information provided.\n\n\n\n\nUpon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.\n\n\nCookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.\n\n\nIf you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at \nprivacy@unbias.co\n.\n\n\n11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES\n\n\nMost web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.\n\n\nCalifornia law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.\n\n\n12.

We may obtain personal data about you from third parties, such as social media platforms, service providers, advertising partners, data analytics partners, event sponsors, publicly available sources, or data providers. We may merge or combine such personal data with the personal data we collect from you directly or automatically.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Data Collected Automatically\n. We, our service providers, and our advertising partners may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your activity over time on our Platform and other websites and online services, such as:\n\n\n\n\n\nDevice Data\n, such as your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, IP address, unique identifiers, the website you visited before browsing to our website, and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.\n\n\n\n\nOnline Activity Data\n, such as login frequency, pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and duration of access.\n\n\n\n\nLike many online services, we use the following technologies to facilitate some of our automatic data collection:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCookies\n, which are text files that websites store on a visitor\u2018s device to uniquely identify the visitor\u2019s browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand user activity and patterns, and facilitating online advertising.\n\n\n\n\nWeb Beacons\n, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are typically used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked, typically to compile statistics about usage of websites and the success of marketing campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nSession replay technologies\n, which are third-party software used to record a video replay of users\u2019 interactions with the Platform. The video replay may include users\u2019 clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, mobile app touches, typing, and other activity taken during the session. We use these replays for research and development purposes, such as to help us troubleshoot problems with the Platform, understand how users interact with and use the Platform, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Data about Others\n. Users of the Platform may have the opportunity to refer other contacts or us.

We use personal data for research and development purposes, including to extract, compile, synthesize, and analyze the usage data, analytics, statistics, and other information and preferences of our users to make our Platform and other offerings better, and to develop new features, services, products, and functionality. As part of these activities, we may create aggregated, de-identified, or other anonymous data from personal data we collect.

To do this, follow the instructions in your browser\u2019s settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Platform and our Site may not work properly.

You can also limit collection of your information for interest-based ads by blocking third party cookies in your browser settings or using privacy plug-ins or ad blocking software that help you block third party cookies. In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for targeted online advertising purposes. If you opt-out of interest-based advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you.\n\nSome of the third party advertising companies we work with offer their own opt-out options that you can use to limit their use of your information for interest-based advertising, such as Google (\ninfo\n and \nopt-out\n) and Facebook (\ninfo\n and \nopt-out\n). Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms or do not participate in the opt-out mechanisms described above. Even after using these opt-out mechanisms, you may receive interest-based advertising from other companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Not Track\n. Some Internet browsers may be configured to send \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals to the online services that you visit. The Site currently does not respond to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d or similar signals.

While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal data from the risks presented by unauthorized access or acquisition, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sites And Services.\n\n\nThe Platform may contain links to other websites and online services operated by third parties.

Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal data. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites and online services you use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Transfers of Personal Data.\n\n\nWe are based in the United States of America, and we have service providers in the United States and potentially other countries. Your personal data may be collected, used, stored, and transferred in these countries or other locations outside of your home country.

If the GDPR does not apply to you, not all terms of this Privacy Policy may be relevant to you.\nAs used in this Privacy Policy,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\nLATITUDE\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \"\nwe\n,\" \"\nour\n\" and \"\nus\n\" means \nLATITUDE, S.L. \nand its affiliates.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\nController\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the purposes of the GDPR, other data protection laws applicable in member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is \nLATITUDE, S.L.\n, C/Alaba 61, 5-2\u00c2\u00aa, 08005 Barcelona.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\nPersonal Information\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d generally has the same meaning as personal data or personal identifiable information (PII). Personal Information is defined in the data privacy laws applicable in your country. It includes any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This means any individual who can be identified directly or indirectly by reference to an identifier such as name, identification number, location data, online identifiers (for example, IP addresses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if they can be used to identify you) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Put simply, this includes data which either by itself or with other data held by us or available to us, can be used to identify you.\nLATITUDE is committed to the following key principles:\nPRINCIPLE 1.\u00a0WE LIMIT HOW, AND WITH WHOM, WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.\nLATITUDE will only share your Personal Information with others for the following purposes:\nat your request;\nto process or service a transaction or product authorized or requested by you; this may include sharing within the LATITUDE group of entities;\nwhen required by law to disclose such information to appropriate authorities;\nto companies that assist us in marketing, recruiting, placement and servicing our products and services; for example, in order to support our information technology or to handle mailings on our behalf; and\nto our professional advisers.\nPRINCIPLE 2.\u00a0PURPOSE AND LEGAL BASIS OF THE PROCESSING\nInformation we receive from you when (i) you visit www.latitude.so and other LATITUDE websites and (ii) any other information you subsequently provide to us orally, in writing or through the internet: this may include your full name, postal address, e-mail address, employer/business and professional information, job titles, telephone and fax numbers, demographic information, IP address\nPurpose:\n \nThe Personal Information is used in providing the website and answering requests from you (e.g. if you choose to register to receive information about our products and services or if you enquire about these, we will use your Personal Information in order to respond).\nLegal Basis: The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at the request of you prior to entering into a contract.

Your data may also be shared with other LATITUDE group companies to consider your application for other job openings.\nLegal Basis: Primarily, the processing is necessary to take steps for entering into a contract with you. We also have a legitimate interest to (i) store your data for a period of \nup to 2 years\n following the conclusion of an unsuccessful application and/or (ii) to share it with the LATITUDE group of entities and/or (iii) to retain and use your data as far as necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nAll of the above\nPurpose: For compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and corporate governance obligations.\nLegal Basis: Processing is necessary for compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject.\nWhere you wish to provide us with Personal Information about another person, including colleagues or the persons you act on behalf of, you must ensure that you have their prior permission to do this.

We may ask you to provide a copy of your proof of identity.\nIf you consider that we are in breach of our obligations under data protection laws, you may lodge a complaint with the competent Data Protection Authority, which may be the supervisory authority in your country of residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of data protection laws.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\nThis privacy policy may be modified from time to time to comply with applicable laws or to conform to our current business practices. We will post any changes to this on our website and will endeavor to notify you via your contact email. When notifying such changes to you, we will also explain what the likely impact of those changes on you will be, if any. We encourage you to revisit the Privacy Statement that is posted on our web site from time to time to check for updates.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE WANT YOU TO KNOW:\nTransfers outside the EU/EEA.\n We also transfer the Personal Information we process to countries outside the European Economic Area (\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nEEA\n\u00e2\u0080\u009d) (e.g., when one of our service providers or equipment is based outside the EEA, such as for hosting your Personal Information). We have put in place adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of your privacy, fundamental rights and freedoms, and the exercise of your rights, e.g. we establish an adequate level of data protection, usually through EU Standard Contractual Clauses based on the EU commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model clauses.\nProvision of Personal Information / Automated decision making.\n Please note that the Personal Information we collect from you is necessary to providing the services and the website to you. Failure to provide such data may not enable us to provide our services to you or make our website accessible. We do not use automatic decision-making or profiling of individuals.\nYour Rights.\n You have various rights under data privacy laws in your country. These may include (as relevant): the right to request access to the Personal Information we hold about you; the right to rectification including to require us to correct inaccurate Personal Information; the right to request restriction of processing concerning you or to object to processing of your Personal Information, the right to request the erasure of your Personal Information where it is no longer necessary for us to retain it; the right to data portability including to obtain Personal Information in a commonly used machine readable format in certain circumstances such as where our processing of it is based on a consent; the right object to automated decision making including profiling (if any) that has a legal or significant effect on you as an individual; and the right to withdraw your consent to any processing for which you have previously given that consent.\nMarketing Information.\n With your consent, where relevant, we will keep your name, address and contact details (including telephone numbers and email addresses) in our databases and may from time to time use that information to make you aware of our related products and services as well as updates on developments in our industry sector generally which may be of interest to you. We may contact you in writing, by telephone or email for this. If at any time you decide that you do not want your contact details used for these purposes, you may object or revoke your consent for receiving marketing communications by following the instructions in the relevant marketing communication (e.g., clicking on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnsubscribe\u00e2\u0080\u009d button) or by contacting us (see \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive Us Your Feedback\u00e2\u0080\u009d above).\nSecurity Statement.\n We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. In particular, we implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including as appropriate: (a) pseudonymization (such as where data is separated from direct identifiers so that linkage to an identity is not possible without additional information that is held separately) and encryption, (b) protecting the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of systems and services used to process your Personal Information, (c) providing the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Information in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and (d) maintaining a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational security measures. When you submit information to us through our website, your information is protected both online and offline. All data transferred to/from the LATITUDE internal network, from/to an external entity, is encrypted to industry standards. Please keep in mind that messages you send to us by Internet e-mail may not be secure. We maintain appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of your personal information within our company. Only those employees who may require your information to perform a specific job are granted access to your organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.\nOur Use of Cookies and Analytic Tools.\n LATITUDE uses \u00e2\u0080\u009ccookies\u00e2\u0080\u009d and analytic tools as further described in our Cookie Policy.\nThird Party Websites.\n Our websites and mobile apps may contain links to third-party websites.

There is no need for users to \"opt out\" of data selling, as we do not engage in this practice.\nAny sharing of information with third parties is strictly limited to what is necessary for the functioning of our services or as required by law. In such cases, these third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide the specific service to us or as mandated by legal requirements.\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nLINKS TO OTHER SITES AND SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES\nWe may create links to other websites that we think may be of interest to you, such as to certain Businesses. We are not affiliated with any third parties featured within, or utilized as part of, the Services (including the Businesses), and are not responsible for their services. \u00c2\u00a0You acknowledge and agree that you will hold the Businesses solely responsible for any transaction between you and the Business, including without limitation the services provided to you by the Business. \nThe Services may also integrate with social media services. We do not control such services and are not liable for the manner in which they operate. While we may provide you with the ability to use such services in connection with the Services, we are doing so as an accommodation and, like you, are relying upon those third-party services to operate properly and fairly. We do not endorse any other websites, providers, or services by providing such links, and this Privacy Policy applies only to your use of the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of any websites and services we link to on the Services, and you should read the privacy policies of each site you visit to determine what data that site may collect about you.\nYou should be aware that any personal information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, forum, social network, or otherwise may be viewed and used by others. By using such features, you assume the risk that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.\nCross-Device Matching\n. We may use your information to help us, or our third-party vendors, determine if you have interacted with the Services across multiple devices and to match such devices. To accomplish this, we may rely on information (including demographic, geographic and interest-based data) from third parties such as data vendors, pursuant to their own privacy policies, or we may use information we collect in conjunction with such third-party data. \nHOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\nPersonal information is maintained on our servers or those of our vendors, and is accessible by authorized employees, independent contractors, representatives, and agents as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We use reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to promote the security of our systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of personal information. However, no method of safeguarding information is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will be effective or sufficient. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at +1 (800) 362-4511 or support@amazeme.co. \nDATA RETENTION\nWe will retain your personal information for as long as your inquiry is active or as needed to provide you with the Services, and for a reasonable time thereafter in accordance with our standard procedures or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Even if we delete some or all of your information, we may continue to retain and use anonymous or aggregate data, or any other data that constitutes non-personal information.

Further information on cookies is available at www.allaboutcookies.org. By deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of the Services or some of its functionality may be affected. \nNote that cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if you have opted out on your device browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. Additionally, if you opt out on one of your devices, that opt out may not be effective on all of your devices. However, please be advised that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on some mobile services.\nSome browsers have a Do Not Track (\u00e2\u0080\u009cDNT\u00e2\u0080\u009d) feature that lets users signal to websites that they do not want to have their online activities tracked. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers; however, we treat Global Privacy Control signals as a means of opting out of the sale or sharing of personal information, as required by applicable law.\nCALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u00e2\u0080\u009cCCPA\u00e2\u0080\u009d), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, and other applicable U.S. state data privacy laws (collectively, \u00e2\u0080\u009cApplicable Privacy Laws\u00e2\u0080\u009d) provide you with specific rights regarding your personal information. This section describes the rights of California residents, and residents of other states, as applicable, and explains how to exercise those rights. The rights in this section are not intended to grant you additional rights, but only your rights under Applicable Privacy Laws.\nRights to Your Information\nRight to Know. \nYou have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure or sale of your personal information over the past 12 months.

When providing us this information, you represent and affirm that all information provided is true and accurate. If we are unable to verify that the consumer submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected personal information, we may contact you for more information, or we may not be able to meet your request.\nOnly you, or an agent legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. If you are making a request as the authorized agent, we will ask you also submit reliable proof that you have been authorized in writing by the consumer to act on such consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf.\nWe will make every effort to respond to your request within 45 days from when you contacted us.

Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of HAVN. The use of the Internet pages of HAVN is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services through our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.\nThe processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to HAVN. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.\nAs the controller, HAVN has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.\n1. Definitions\nThe data protection declaration of HAVN is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.\nIn this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Personal data\n \nmeans any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data subject\n \nData subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.\nc)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Processing\n \nis any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.\nd)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Restriction of processing\n \nis the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.\ne)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Profiling\n \nmeans any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.\nf)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pseudonymisation\n \nis the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.\ng)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Controller or controller responsible for the processing\n \nfor the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.\nh)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Processor\n \nis a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.\ni)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recipient\n \nis a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.\nj)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third party\n \nis a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.\nk)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consent\n \nof the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n2. Name and Address of the controller\nController for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is:\nHAVN\n\u00a0\nEmail: hello@havnwear.com\nWebsite: www.havnwear.com\n3. Cookies\nThe Internet pages of the HAVN use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.\nMany Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.\nThrough the use of cookies, the HAVN can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.\nBy means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user\u2019s computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.\nThe data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.\n4. Collection of general data and information\nThe website of HAVN collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.\nWhen using these general data and information, HAVN does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, HAVN analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.\n5. Registration on our website\nThe data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.\nBy registering on the website of the controller, the IP address\u2014assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject\u2014date, and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.\nThe registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.\nThe data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations. The entirety of the controller\u2019s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons.\n6. Contact possibility via the website\nThe website of HAVN contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.\nIn addition, you agree to our Messaging Terms (https://terms.pscr.pt/legal/shop/spartanunderwear/terms_of_service) and Messaging Privacy Policy (https://terms.pscr.pt/legal/shop/spartanunderwear/privacy_policy)\n7. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data\nThe data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.\nIf the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.\n8. Rights of the data subject\na) Right of confirmation\n \nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\nb) Right of access\n \nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information:\nthe purposes of the processing;\nthe categories of personal data concerned;\nthe recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;\nwhere possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\nthe existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing;\nthe existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\nwhere the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;\nthe existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\nFurthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.\nIf a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\nc) Right to rectification\n \nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\nIf a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\nd) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)\n \nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:\nThe personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.\nThe data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.\nThe data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.\nThe personal data have been unlawfully processed.\nThe personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.\nThe personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.\nIf one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by\u00a0 HAVN, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An employee of HAVN shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.\nWhere the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An employees of\u00a0 HAVN will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.\ne) Right of restriction of processing\n \nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:\nThe accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.\nThe processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.\nThe controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\nThe data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.\nIf one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by\u00a0 HAVN, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The employee of\u00a0 HAVN will arrange the restriction of the processing.\nf) Right to data portability\n \nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\nFurthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\nIn order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of\u00a0 HAVN.\ng) Right to object\n \nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.\nHAVN shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\nIf\u00a0 HAVN processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to\u00a0 HAVN to the processing for direct marketing purposes,\u00a0 HAVN will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.\nIn addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by\u00a0 HAVN for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.\nIn order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of\u00a0 HAVN. In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.\nh) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling\n \nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject\u2019s explicit consent.\nIf the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject\u2019s explicit consent,\u00a0 HAVN shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.\nIf the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of\u00a0 HAVN.\ni) Right to withdraw data protection consent\n \nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.\nIf the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of\u00a0 HAVN.\n9. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook\nOn this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a social network.\nA social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.\nThe operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.\nIf the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject\u2014and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site\u2014which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the \u201cLike\u201d button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.\nFacebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.\nThe data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.\n10. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)\nOn this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.\nThe operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.\nFor the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application \u201c_gat. _anonymizeIp\u201d. By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\nThe purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.\nGoogle Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.\nThe cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\nThe data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.\nIn addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.\nFurther information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link https://www.google.com/analytics/.\n11. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Remarketing\nOn this website, the controller has integrated Google Remarketing services. Google Remarketing is a feature of Google AdWords, which allows an enterprise to display advertising to Internet users who have previously resided on the enterprise\u2019s Internet site. The integration of Google Remarketing therefore allows an enterprise to create user-based advertising and thus shows relevant advertisements to interested Internet users.\nThe operating company of the Google Remarketing services is the Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.\nThe purpose of Google Remarketing is the insertion of interest-relevant advertising. Google Remarketing allows us to display ads on the Google network or on other websites, which are based on individual needs and matched to the interests of Internet users.\nGoogle Remarketing sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google enables a recognition of the visitor of our website if he calls up consecutive web pages, which are also a member of the Google advertising network. With each call-up to an Internet site on which the service has been integrated by Google Remarketing, the web browser of the data subject identifies automatically with Google. During the course of this technical procedure, Google receives personal information, such as the IP address or the surfing behaviour of the user, which Google uses, inter alia, for the insertion of interest relevant advertising.\nThe cookie is used to store personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\nThe data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.\nIn addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to the interest-based advertising by Google. For this purpose, the data subject must call up the link to www.google.de/settings/ads and make the desired settings on each Internet browser used by the data subject.\nFurther information and the actual data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.\n12. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google-AdWords\nOn this website, the controller has integrated Google AdWords. Google AdWords is a service for Internet advertising that allows the advertiser to place ads in Google search engine results and the Google advertising network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-define specific keywords with the help of which an ad on Google\u2019s search results only then displayed, when the user utilizes the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result. In the Google Advertising Network, the ads are distributed on relevant web pages using an automatic algorithm, taking into account the previously defined keywords.\nThe operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, UNITED STATES.\nThe purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising on the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of third-party advertising on our website.\nIf a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information technology system of the data subject through Google. The definition of cookies is explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the data subject. If the cookie has not expired, the conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g, the shopping cart from an online shop system, were called up on our website. Through the conversion cookie, both Google and the controller can understand whether a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, that is, executed or canceled a sale of goods.\nThe data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users who have been served through AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads in the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the data subject.\nThe conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\nThe data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.\nThe data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest based advertisement of Google. Therefore, the data subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link www.google.de/settings/ads and set the desired settings.\nFurther information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.\n13. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Instagram\nOn this website, the controller has integrated components of the service Instagram. Instagram is a service that may be qualified as an audiovisual platform, which allows users to share photos and videos, as well as disseminate such data in other social networks.\nThe operating company of the services offered by Instagram is Instagram LLC, 1 Hacker Way, Building 14 First Floor, Menlo Park, CA, UNITED STATES.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which an Instagram component (Insta button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a display of the corresponding Instagram component of Instagram. During the course of this technical procedure, Instagram becomes aware of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.\nIf the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram, Instagram detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject\u2014and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site\u2014which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Instagram component and is associated with the respective Instagram account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website, then Instagram matches this information with the personal Instagram user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.\nInstagram receives information via the Instagram component that the data subject has visited our website provided that the data subject is logged in at Instagram at the time of the call to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Instagram button or not. If such a transmission of information to Instagram is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by logging off from their Instagram account before a call-up to our website is made.\nFurther information and the applicable data protection provisions of Instagram may be retrieved under https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388 and https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/privacy/.\n14. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Twitter\nOn this website, the controller has integrated components of Twitter. Twitter is a multilingual, publicly-accessible microblogging service on which users may publish and spread so-called \u2018tweets,\u2019 e.g. short messages, which are limited to 280 characters. These short messages are available for everyone, including those who are not logged on to Twitter. The tweets are also displayed to so-called followers of the respective user. Followers are other Twitter users who follow a user\u2019s tweets. Furthermore, Twitter allows you to address a wide audience via hashtags, links or retweets.\nThe operating company of Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, UNITED STATES.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a Twitter component (Twitter button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding Twitter component of Twitter. Further information about the Twitter buttons is available under https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons. During the course of this technical procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject. The purpose of the integration of the Twitter component is a retransmission of the contents of this website to allow our users to introduce this web page to the digital world and increase our visitor numbers.\nIf the data subject is logged in at the same time on Twitter, Twitter detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Twitter component and associated with the respective Twitter account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Twitter buttons integrated on our website, then Twitter assigns this information to the personal Twitter user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.\nTwitter receives information via the Twitter component that the data subject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in on Twitter at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Twitter component or not. If such a transmission of information to Twitter is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Twitter account before a call-up to our website is made.\nThe applicable data protection provisions of Twitter may be accessed under https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en.\n15. Payment Method: Data protection provisions about the use of PayPal as a payment processor\nOn this website, the controller has integrated components of PayPal. PayPal is an online payment service provider. Payments are processed via so-called PayPal accounts, which represent virtual private or business accounts. PayPal is also able to process virtual payments through credit cards when a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal account is managed via an e-mail address, which is why there are no classic account numbers. PayPal makes it possible to trigger online payments to third parties or to receive payments. PayPal also accepts trustee functions and offers buyer protection services.\nThe European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.\u00e0.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.\nIf the data subject chooses \u201cPayPal\u201d as the payment option in the online shop during the ordering process, we automatically transmit the data of the data subject to PayPal. By selecting this payment option, the data subject agrees to the transfer of personal data required for payment processing.\nThe personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name, last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, mobile phone number, or other data necessary for payment processing. The processing of the purchase contract also requires such personal data, which are in connection with the respective order.\nThe transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud prevention. The controller will transfer personal data to PayPal, in particular, if a legitimate interest in the transmission is given. The personal data exchanged between PayPal and the controller for the processing of the data will be transmitted by PayPal to economic credit agencies. This transmission is intended for identity and creditworthiness checks.\nPayPal will, if necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service providers or subcontractors to the extent that this is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be processed in the order.\nThe data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from PayPal. A revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual) payment processing.\nThe applicable data protection provisions of PayPal may be retrieved under https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.\n16. Legal basis for the processing\nArt. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n17. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party\nWhere the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.\n18. Period for which the personal data will be stored\nThe criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.\n19. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data\nWe clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\n20.

If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at \n[email\u00a0protected]\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWill WeHealth ever change this Privacy Policy\n?\n\n\nWe\u2019re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the WeHealth dashboard, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you\u2019ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven\u2019t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhat Information does WeHealth Collect\n?\n\n\nInformation You Provide to Us:\n\n\nWe receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Twitter or Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service], you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (\u201cThird Party Account Information\u201d) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy, for example, you list of friends may be accessed Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.\n\n\nWe may communicate with you if you\u2019ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you\u2019ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing us at \n[email\u00a0protected]\n.\n\n\nInformation Collected Automatically\n\n\nWhenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, \u201ccookie\u201d information, the type of browser and/or device you\u2019re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. \u201cCookies\u201d are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device\u2019s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren\u2019t responsible for their privacy policies and practices.\n\n\nWe may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services \u2013 for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nInformation Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy\n\n\nThrough cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.\n\n\nWill WeHealth Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives\n?\n\n\nWe neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:\n\n\nInformation that\u2019s no longer personally identifiable. \nWe may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.\n\n\nWe use a tool called \u201cGoogle Analytics\u201d to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the\u00a0IP\u00a0address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google\u2019s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the\u00a0\nGoogle Analytics Terms of Use\n and the\u00a0Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by\u00a0\ndisabling cookies\n\u00a0on your browser.\n\n\nAffiliated Businesses:\n In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we\u2019re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account; for example, accessing you friend list from Facebook. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business\u2019 or websites\u2019 policies.\n\n\nAgents:\n We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing Company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.\n\n\nUser Profiles and Submissions:\n Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services. [Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others.] Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of \u201cfriends\u201d from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such \u201cfriends,\u201d if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.\n\n\nBusiness Transfers:\n We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.\n\n\nProtection of WeHealth and Others:\n We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we [reasonably] believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of use (\nlink\n) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of WeHealth, our employees, our users, or others.\n\n\nIs Personal Information about me secure\n?\n\n\nYour account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.\n\n\nWe endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.\n\n\nWhat Personal Information can I access\n?\n\n\nThrough your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you\u2019ve provided to us:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nPhone\n\n\nUser Profile Description\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at \n[email\u00a0protected]\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to: \n[email\u00a0protected]\n.\n\n\nWhat choices do I have\n?\n\n\nYou can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.\n\n\nYou may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by contacting us at \n[email\u00a0protected]\n. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.\n\n\nWhat if I have questions about this policy?\n\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to \n[email\u00a0protected]\n, and we will try to resolve your concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Policy - HIPAA\n\n\nWeHealth is committed to maintaining the privacy of your health information. This Notice explains how that information, called \u201cProtected Health Information\u201d (PHI), may be used and disclosed to others.

Other companies or persons that perform services on our behalf, called Business Associates, must also protect the privacy of your information. Business Associates are not allowed to release your information to anyone else unless specifically permitted by law.\n\n\nWhat Health Information We Collect\n\n\nAs part of our services we may collect information about your symptoms in order to match you with appropriate resources.

We may disclose your health information to a law enforcement official if required or allowed by law. We may also disclose information about you to law enforcement that is not a part of your health record for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\nTo identify or locate a suspect, material witness, victim of a crime, or missing person\n\n\nAbout a death we believe may be the result of criminal conduct\n\n\nAbout criminal conduct at our location \n\n\nIn emergency circumstances to report a crime; the location of the crime or victims; or the identity, description or location of the person who committed the crime.\n\n\n\n\nHealth Oversight Activities:\n We must disclose health information to a health oversight agency for activities that are required by federal, state or local law. Oversight activities include investigations, inspections, industry licensures, and government audits. These activities are necessary to enable government agencies to monitor various health care systems, government programs, and industry compliance with civil rights laws. \n\n\nPublic Health Risks:\n As authorized by law, we may disclose health information about you to public health or legal authorities whose official responsibilities generally include the following:\n\n\n\n\nTo prevent or control disease, injury or disability;\n\n\nTo report births and deaths;\n\n\nTo report child abuse or neglect;\n\n\nTo report reactions to medications or problems with products;\n\n\nTo notify people of recalls of products they may be using;\n\n\nTo notify a person who may have been exposed to a disease or may be at risk for contracting or spreading a disease or condition; and\n\n\nTo notify the appropriate government authority if we believe a patient has been the victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. We will only make this disclosure if you agree or when required or authorized by law.\n\n\n\n\nSerious Threat to Health or Safety:\n Consistent with applicable laws, we may disclose your health information if the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public.

We may charge you a reasonable fee to cover duplication, mailing and other costs incurred by us in complying with your request.

We retain the right to terminate an agreed-to restriction if we believe such termination is appropriate. In the event of a termination by us, we will notify you of such termination. You also have the right to terminate, in writing or orally, any agreed-to restriction. If we agree to the requested restriction, we may not use or disclose your personal information in violation of that restriction unless it is needed to provide emergency treatment.\n\n\n\n\nRight to Request Amendment:\n If you believe that any health information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to change the information for as long as WeHealth maintains the information.

Your request must specify how or where you wish to be contacted. We will accommodate all reasonable requests. \n\n\nRight to Receive an Accounting of Certain Disclosures:\n With some exceptions, you have the right to receive an accounting of certain disclosures we have made, if any, of your health information. Your accounting request must be in writing and signed by you or your personal representative and submitted to WeHealth. Your request must specify the time in which the disclosures were made. You may receive one free accounting in any 12-month period. We will charge you for additional requests. This right only applies to disclosures for purposes other than treatment, payment or health care operations as described in this Notice. It also excludes disclosures we may have made to you, your family members or friends involved in your care. The right to receive this information is subject to certain exceptions, restrictions and limitations as allowed by HIPAA.\n\n\nRight to Obtain a Copy of this Notice:\n You have the right to receive a paper copy of this Notice upon request, even if you have agreed to receive the Notice electronically. You may ask us to give you a copy of this Notice at any time.\n\n\nRight to Cancel Authorization to Use or Disclose:\n Other uses and disclosures of your health information not covered by this Notice or the laws that govern us will be made only with your written authorization. You have the right to revoke your authorization in writing at any time, and we will discontinue future uses and disclosures of your health information for the reasons covered by your authorization. We are unable to take back any disclosures that were already made with your authorization, and we are required to retain the records of the care that we provided to you. \n\n\n\n\nIn addition, you have the right to be notified if you are affected by a breach of unsecured personal information.\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS/CONTACT US\n\n\nIf you believe that we have violated your privacy rights, you may file a complaint with us by notifying us at \n[email\u00a0protected]\n.

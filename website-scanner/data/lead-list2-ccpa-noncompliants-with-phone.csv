Help them grow faster than they have on their own. If your sales are slumping, or have flattened, I can help with that too.

I have been in the mix for over 15 years. My passion is to help small business owners like you grow their business. I am a generalist small business marketing consultant, having worked with clients in several industries. All small businesses like yours. I believe this makes me a better consultant than those who specialize.

I don't make any assumptions going into your project, and my recommendations are artisanal-built from scratch for you. I create your marketing as unique as your business. You started your small business knowing you can do it better than the rest. Then why should your marketing be like the rest? It shouldn't!

I never use a one size fits all marketing template. If you think about it, when has one size fits all ever looked good? Never! Neither does one size fits all marketing. That's why I have a proven process. I call it The Nagrath Formula. It's a proven process, not a template!

My Nagrath Formula has proven itself to be a fast and relatively inexpensive way to develop successful marketing. No matter the industry. No matter the business. My process is the same. My results are the same, more leads, and faster growth.

I am sure you have questions. Browse my website to learn more about me and my process. Let's talk when you're ready on how we can work together. Just two business owners talking.

We use only the finest couverture chocolate and other ingredients, carefully handcrafting every one of our chocolates in our Northern California kitchens to create chocolate that's worth lingering over. It's the perfect treat for late-night visits with old friends, overdue romantic moments, and quiet mornings all to yourself. From our hot chocolate sticks to our creamy marshmallows, our products remind busy people to take time for the pleasure of small things.

Our founders, AmberLee & Andrea, are sisters-in-law who grew up in very different parts of the world—AmberLee in a ridiculously picturesque part of the Maracaibo region of Venezuela, and Andrea in the amazing culinary hub that is the California Bay Area—but together they shared a life-long love of all things chocolate. After Amberlee married Andrea's brother and relocated to Northern California, the dream and vision of Ticket Chocolate began to percolate.

Our owner, Tyler, became good friends with AmberLee and her husband during their college years, when he was known as the guy who cooked up actual real meals and sat down to them for dinner. Tyler went on to receive his MBA at Babson College in Wellesley, MA before joining Team Ticket, taking ownership in early 2013. Tyler has a penchant for traveling, gardening, coaching his children's sports teams, and he probably (if this is possible) loves chocolate even more than the rest of us! Tyler makes his home in the foothills of Northern California with his wife, daughter, and twin toddlers.

Our name. Like a great trip, we want our chocolate to be a part of moments to remember. We want to create chocolate and sweets that send you…

Born in Pennsylvania, Tracy began drawing as soon as she could hold a crayon in her hand. She studied privately as a child and completed her Bachelorʼs degree in painting and drawing at Tyler School of Art / Temple University in Philadelphia.

Tracy discovered street painting by chance in 1998 and made the decision to pursue this art form full time. Tracy has presented her work at events around the globe, including the Super Bowl, the Olympics, Katy Perry & Honda's iconic ‘The Impossible Made Possible' commercial. Her 3d anamorphic paintings have won numerous awards & accolades, including a Guinness World Record in 2006 for the Largest Chalk Painting by an Individual.

A published author, Tracy released ʻThe Art of Chalkʼ in 2016 through Quarto Publishing, USA. A practical guidebook for anyone interested in how to create 3D chalk art, the book also highlights techniques and inspiration for chalkboard art and pastel fine art, including tips and methods from over 50 international artists.

Tracy's latest venture, & long held dream, is the establishment of the TiLT Museums brand. In an effort to bring art and enjoyment to everyone through hand-painted, experiential 3D artworks, TiLT's flagship location at American Dream is scheduled to open in April 2021.","Tracy Lee Stum is a leading 3D Chalk Artist best known for creating modern chalk art, large 3D commercial street paintings, and 3D street chalk art.",0.0,,,"{'certificate_errors': ['Hostname not found in certificate SAN: tracyleestum.com, *.tracyleestum.com'], 'header_errors': ['HSTS header missing', 'Content-Security-Policy header missing', 'X-Content-Type-Options header missing', 'X-Frame-Options header missing', 'Referrer-Policy header missing', 'X-XSS-Protection header missing']}",No privacy policy found on the website.,"Your website has some security gaps, like missing important headers and certificate issues, and it’s also missing a privacy policy, which helps build trust with visitors."

Monarch's philosophy: 
Our team believes in the importance of a collaborative approach when it comes to diagnosis and treatment. Our approach and treatment model incorporate a multidisciplinary team where all clinicians collectively come together to contribute to the well being of a child. We understand this journey can be overwhelming and we are here to answer your questions and provide the support that you need, every step of the way. 

Above all, we understand that without a mutual connection and understanding of the whole child, treatment modalities may be limited. In addition to providing science-based services, our well-trained clinicians go the extra distance to establish a connection with every child and their family to ensure the success of treatment. 

It is our team's privilege to support you and your child through this journey. Our mission is to provide clarity and consistency, and work with you to create an environment where your child can grow and prosper.

For over 6,000 years, humans have enjoyed wine as a natural product—free from artificial sweeteners and naturally low in sugar and carbs. But the wine industry lost its way, bogged down by stale pours, low-quality house wines, and unnecessary rules. At Los Cuernos, we're bringing wine back to its roots while making it modern, approachable, and accessible for everyone.

Crafted from California's finest fruit, our wines deliver a fresh glass and a half in every can. Whether paired with pizza, tacos, or burgers, or enjoyed at a casual restaurant, a backyard barbecue, or on an outdoor adventure, Los Cuernos brings high-quality wine to more occasions and more people.

We're improving many people's first introduction to wine by making it simple, fresh, and exceptional. Because wine doesn't need to be overcomplicated—it just needs to be great.

They were sitting in the hospital room with Tracie's younger brother, Drew Nenow, chatting about their dreams for the future and enjoying time with the newest member of the family. A love of wine runs deep in this family and the conversation shifted to talking about the possibility of one day coming together and starting their own label.

Through the support from many family members, countless brainstorming sessions and a ton of hard work, in 2017 the family purchased their first grapes. Through Nenow Family Wines, the Roesberys and the Nenows have a desire to create a legacy for their families and to always remain committed to produce unique wine based on quality, care and love – which is what you will experience with each bottle you enjoy.

The business model is simple. Do what they love and make really good wine!

The family is committed to sourcing from vineyards that are dedicated to farming their grapes with quality and care, rather than quantity. From there, winemaker Drew focuses on using the truth of the fruit to create a wine they are proud of!

Together, the family works tirelessly to bring the masterpiece of amazing wine to your table, hopefully to be enjoyed with those you love the most!

The Collective Sound (TCS) was established in 1998 as a non-profit organization educating youth, ages
12 to 18, utilizing a contemporary curriculum that includes writing, recording, and performing original
music. TCS nurtures tomorrow's innovators and leaders by providing music resources, programs, and
environments through summer academies and after school programs throughout the US and Europe.
TCS has created programs at CSU Chico, St. Mary's College, The Boys & Girls Club of Venice and
Laguna Beach, Calistoga High School, Chico High School, Vanguard University, Concordia University,
Bournemouth University, University Of Barcelona and Ex'pression College for Digital Arts.

- Our Goal -
The goal of The Collective Sound is to provide resources that empower young musicians to develop
their creativity in a guided collaborative environment. The Collective Sound aims to challenge the
boundaries of music education with a curriculum that includes musicology, songwriting, recording
technology, video, photography, music industry guest lectures, band clinics, field trips, live performance
and touring. We believe that it is important for our programs to utilize the current state of independent
and popular music to connect with our students via culturally relevant artistic movements. Students not
only grow in their musical proficiency, but they also develop their creative thinking, collaborative skills,
and understanding of current technologies. The inherent character development carries through to
many of life's challenges facing youth. The ability to develop ideas, communicate them with others,
and share them with the world is an invaluable practice.","Teen Summer Music Camp - Write, Record and Perform Original Music with a Band.

Led by a seasoned team with more than 50 years combined experience in glass blowing and manufacturing, we are proud to bring American-made products to market with health, quality, and artistry top of mind.

SI was founded in 2009 by veterans of the glass blowing industry with a reputation for producing high-quality products. The team saw an opportunity to bring to market a cleaner, healthier way to smoke, and thus began the development of the industry's first, and only, premium filtration device.

Our triple-filtered product line uses a revolutionary system that helps extract tars and impurities so you can enjoy a cleaner, cooler inhalation reducing or eliminating deadly carcinogens and pesticides entering your body through the smoke. 

The triple-filtered process starts with Virgin Coconut Carbon.  The granular shape of our carbon significantly increases surface and pore diffusion rates increasing its effectiveness with a short contact time. The second stage of this process diffuses the inhalation through percs and slits in the glass and into water where the smoke is cooled and additional impurities are removed from the surface of the many small smoke bubbles.  Last, the smoke passes through our Organic Cotton where it is filtered for the third time to trap and remove further impurities. 

This unique system backed by independent research which proves this system filters out between 75% and 100% of pesticides and carcinogens resulting in the healthiest way to enjoy every inhalation.  

We know your health is your wealth.  So when you need to inhale, choose a filtration device that provides a healthier, smoother, tastier experience. 

The SI headquarters and manufacturing facility are located in the Sierra Foothills just outside Sacramento, California.

Each tamper proof seal comes with a unique serial number and scratch-off verifcation code with a scannable QR code. The consumer can scan the QR code or enter the product serial number on www.cannverify.com to check our product details provided by the manufacturer. The consumer can then enter the one-time-use scratch-off verification code to verify if the product is authentic. Manufacturers will be provided with a login account where you will be able to activate/deactivate and input detailed information for each product assigned to a serial number.

For those who seek the exceptional, Blue Garnet is the rare management firm that offers exactly that. We create structure around ambiguity. We value process while delivering analytical rigor. We consider implementation as much as we do strategy. We ground visionary goals with financial rigor, as we free clients to dream big. We make strategy real.

We blend social mindedness with the same rigor and standards for excellence practiced by top-tier management consulting firms. By fusing these two elements, we form a rare company that is ready to tackle the social sector's most pressing issues.

We specialize in working with organizations that pursue a triple bottom line, supporting their vision of creating lasting social impact through social entrepreneurship and innovation.

Founded by two Swedish brothers. We started in Hollywood and since 2022 we are located in Beverly Hills. With strong connections internationally we work mainly with international fashion models. The models we fly in have worked successfully in markets such as Paris, Milan, London or New York. We also scout local new faces to work in other markets. 

Bounty is already known for strong fashion models and clients like Alexander Wang, Louis Vuitton and Armani book from us. Runway is our strong side and we always have a group of experienced runway models in town. 
Something that makes us different to other agencies in LA is that we care more about personality than social media following. When clients book from us they know they can expect a professional model who will do her best.

Do you love trees? Do you love farmers? Are you looking for an investment that can impact climate change?

World Tree is a group of investors, business people, farmers and tree-huggers who are fighting climate change and making money through planting trees. 

Our program is based on the Empress Splendor Tree. Empress Splendor trees are the fastest growing hardwood trees in the world. Within just 10 years, they grow into mature trees that can be harvested and sold for lumber. 

We are planting trees with our network of farmers in North and Central America for the purposes of timber production and carbon sequestration. When the trees mature, they are harvested for the lumber and we share the profits with our farmers and investors.","Transforming wealth into investments that do well, by doing good.

Our B2B SaaS platform saves time and money for wholesale buyers.

Selecting the right items for a retail business, whether it's an online business or brick & mortar, and whether it's a small boutique or enterprise, is an ongoing and complex affair. The frequency of buying has increased, and the number of goods bought has grown.  

Yet, today most buyers still rely on memory, notebook, and camera to plan their purchases. As a result, they lose overview and make costly mistakes. 

Using FAVES, buyers have an instant and compressive overview across all their purchases in the palm of their hand.
With a few taps, they get a visual overview of all they have seen and bought, including the necessary order details, and an automatically updated budget.

We help families with critically ill children in Santa Barbara County by providing financial and personal assistance.

Our Vision
Every family with a critically ill child becomes part of a supportive and caring community.


Our Story
Hearts Aligned, Inc. was formed to support families in the tri-counties of Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo that have a critically ill child. We were established in 2021 in response to a growing need from conversations with a diverse group of families impacted by a variety of childhood illnesses. Our support will be broad based to fill the gaps for families not served by others who may specialize in one particular area. We provide financial support and personal assistance to families who are struggling with the daily stress of providing for their family. Beyond financial support, we are there to walk with these families, to create connections for them, empowerment them, and help deliver peace in their lives.

What is Assisted Stretching?
1-on-1 Assisted Stretch Therapy is a new concept in health and wellness. It is essentially body stretching done for you by a pro! This therapy involves being stretched out on a table by a therapist who maneuvers the body into multi-angled positions with the aim of elongating the muscles. When stretching is done for you, a deeper and more prolific stretch is the result. A stretch therapist can apply more pressure and has professional knowledge of the precise angles required to give the maximum benefit. Assisted Stretch Therapy can relieve the pain which occurs as a result of tight muscles.

We offer a variety of length stretch sessions starting with 20 mins for a basic stretch, then 30 minute, 40 minute and 60 minute sessions. Sessions can be bought individually or as packages.

Valentino Achak Deng was born in southern Sudan, in the village of Marial Bai. He fled Sudan in the late 1980's during civil war, when his village was destroyed. Deng grew up in Ethiopian and Kenyan refugee camps, where he worked for the UNHCR as a social advocate and reproductive health educator. Deng has toured the US and Europe speaking about his life in South Sudan, his experience as a refugee, and his collaboration with author Dave Eggers on What Is the What, the novelized version of Deng's life story.

We guide students through the all aspects of the college search and applications process including guidance on the following: high school course selection, extracurricular activities and summer programs, test preparation, college research, financial aid overview, balanced list creation, activities list, mock interviewing, and the college essay. All of our guidance and recommendations stem from finding the right match for each student we work with. We spend time meeting with students individually and getting to know their preferences. Typically, the earlier we start working with a student, the richer and more productive that relationship becomes. We use the data culled from students' academic and personal profiles as well as from the colleges to guide our recommendations. College data changes each year, and we are vigilant about getting the most up-to-date information. It is crucial that students understand their admissions chances, and we provide detailed, custom narratives as a well as access to detailed data charts that convey this. We makes clear recommendations regarding how students can create a balanced list of schools to apply to. It's all about strategic admissions. As students begin to narrow down their college lists, we look closely at the criteria that each college views as important, and we discuss strategies to maximize students' chances using these criteria.","Tracy Ganzer Haferling independent college counselor in Irvine committed to helping students and families navigate college admissions and the application process.

In 2020, two lone-wolves banded together in the simple effort to put a roof over the heads of all their talented and wayward solo wolf friends. These colleagues ranged from film directors to painters, musicians to editors, VFX artists to entrepreneurs. Just cool people doing cool stuff in a million directions.

There wasn't much of a plan. But that wasn't the point. They had the most unique artists in the world... making tomorrow's culture in the same room... all drinking La Croix and Celsius out of the same fridge.

Mission accomplished.

Then those founding wolves realized someone would need to pay for that roof... and that La Croix... and that Celsius. Turns out drinks go fast. So they turned to the pack and figured out how everyone could combine disparate strengths to create a singular value add. Thus, the ragtag collective evolved from a chaotic art house where ""anything goes"" to a streamlined new-age studio where any dream felt like an inevitable reality. 

Today, that superpack creates work that challenges audiences to reexamine their familiar worlds by confronting unfamiliar stories.

Dogs on the euthanasia list receive priority to rescue. They are brought to the MMDR rescue ranch where they decompress, receive training/enrichment/medical care and are placed into foster care or adopted.  Marley's Mutts has capacity limitations as do the shelters. We established Marley's Mutts Movers, a program that works with local shelters to transport up to 41 dogs per month to rescues in Oregon, Washington and Canada. These rescue partners receive the dogs, place them in foster care or the dogs may be immediately adopted. This effort significantly contributes to the welfare of dogs and helps connect them with loving homes. Mutt Movers saved 395 dogs last year and hopes to increase tht number to 500/year.
Marley's Mutts is also a co-founding member of Kern SAFE (Saving Animals From Euthanasia) Animal Coalition, a partnership composed of dedicated rescue groups, shelters and volunteers working together to address and implement practices best serving pets and their owners by providing no-cost spay/neuter, vaccinations and microchipping and dog tags to underserved/underprivileged neighborhoods.
Another no-cost program administered by Marley's is Miracle Mutts, a Therapy Dog Program (Animal Assisted Therapy and Education) serving Kern County Library in aiding children's reading and literacy, Kern County Behavioral Health, Dignity Health Hospital System and Kern County Court Appointed Special Advocates' children in foster care.

Your employees are your not-so-secret weapon. 

They hold your trade secrets. 

They are your most expensive line item. 

You are fully invested in them; have you made sure they are fully invested in you?

Almost everyone has something that sets them apart, something that makes them different from societal ""norms."" Be it race, ethnicity, national origin, family makeup, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, physical or mental ability, veteran status, age, or political affiliation, every employee brings only the parts of themselves that they feel are safe to share with colleagues into the workplace. 

If that is anything less than 100% of themselves, then your employees are focused on protecting the rest from discovery. This costs energy – energy that would be better spent on the work that you have hired them to do. 

Don't you want to have the full value of your investment in the people you have carefully chosen to hire?

We can help you use your powers for good. Together we can identify barriers, strategize how you can remove them, and help you to increase the number of diverse employees you attract and retain by creating a metaclusive environment. 

Whether you are at the very beginning of this effort or have already taken many steps towards inclusivity, we want to help you go to the next level.

Being different can be like having a secret identity. Secret identities are difficult to maintain and take tremendous energy – just ask Wonder Woman or Superman. It is much better to embrace your identity and live openly.

At Metaclusive, we are anti-secret identity and strive to help you remove every obstacle and barrier so your employees can bring their whole selves to work.

That's why photography was the perfect outlet to unleash my creativity through visual storytelling. 15 years later, I can confidently deliver relatable and refreshing visual content through a meticulous understanding of any client's vision.


How do I do that? It's mostly lighting ;)...


But I rely on creative collaborations, by utilizing a carefully curated crew and high-quality production resources to push visual boundaries for all my clients.  My professional philosophy is rooted in always providing a relaxed and fun atmosphere, putting nearly any subject, client, or crew member at ease with my easygoing and fun-loving personality. 


I've always prioritized a ""listen-first"" approach. I lead with empathy and acknowledge that bringing out the best in everyone requires patience and understanding. In order to bring out distinct and artistic looks in each campaign and project, I apply a diligent process, for planning and organization, so that everything is ready ahead of schedule on set, and on-time for delivery.

My background as a fashion coordinator at H&M in Sweden honed my eye for detail, but it was my move to New York that plunged me into the beautiful world of photography.

Here, people of all ages and abilities practice yoga and meditation in an earth-friendly environment, supported by nurturing, experienced teachers and fellow practitioners. We offer a wide range of daily classes, workshops and events in diverse styles for adults, children, and families. 

Our teachers are on their mats practicing like our students. They are guides to inspire safe yoga practice which evolves as students gain knowledge about their body and mind. All our teachers are certified and most have advanced training in specialized disciplines and styles.

Our classes range from beginner classes for yoga novices to advanced classes and workshops for advanced students and teachers. For beginners we focus on teaching the fundamentals of poses; for advanced students and teachers the focus is on going deeper and developing personal practices.  Led by our most senior teachers and nationally acclaimed Yoga Masters, Nandi offers workshops and other special events for students to explore the many aspects of yoga in depth and breadth.

We consciously created a space that embraces sustainability.  We can all make a difference — right now — in the choices we make, to protect the environment for ourselves and future generations. We are proud that our studio is one of the greenest in the country, using recycled and sustainable materials and state-of-the-art fixtures that minimize consumption of natural resources and have been recognized since March 2009 by San Mateo County's Green Business Program.

Back then, we introduced the multivendor marketplace software that has now become the leading self-hosted multivendor solution on the market. CS-Cart Multi-Vendor, the award-winning marketplace platform, is now our flagship product. It was featured on the world's most popular software review and comparison websites such as SourceForge, Capterra, Crozdesk, and others as the leading marketplace software in 2020 and 2021.

Online marketplaces are the main force in eCommerce now. These types of online multivendor sales platforms have taken over a huge share of the market and influenced the online shopping experience dramatically. Customers got used to shopping on large marketplaces such as Amazon: they anticipate a large product range, competitive prices, and excellent customer service and buying experience. That's why we put much effort into developing the best multivendor marketplace software system that meets online shopping trends and customer buying behavior.

CS-Cart Multi-Vendor is an on-premise licensed software. But we kept the source code open for maximum customizability and scalability. That's why CS-Cart Multi-Vendor is so adored by large companies that develop custom marketplaces. But it doesn't mean that you can't open a small niche multi vendor eCommerce website on our marketplace software: there are hundreds of niche marketplaces on CS-Cart—be sure to check the ""Clients"" section on our website. CS-Cart Multi-Vendor comes in various editions that make it suitable for both SMEs and Enterprises.

To keep making our online marketplace solution better, so that it meets fast-changing client's needs, we have a dedicated development team and a customer care team, aside from marketing and sales departments. Among the developers, we have talented PHP programmers, JS-experts, and other pros that literally can do magic. And we're constantly looking for talented professionals.","Experienced multi-vendor software and marketplace developer with more than 40,000 customers in the US and around the world.

Literally translating to ""the floating world,"" the Ukiyo-e genre is all about traveling, female beauty, and living in the moment — could it get any better?

The mill takes ocean wastes (such as sunken fishing nets) and pre-consumer waste products (things people might throw away in production) and turns them into dreamy, luxurious textiles.

Another thing we're all about? Sustainability. As we move towards becoming a fully sustainable brand, we're always working on ways to continuously reduce our carbon footprint. One of our goals is to completely eliminate plastics within our system over the next three years — that's right, no plastic in our packaging or systems.

It is the exponent that overlays every Plan and drives the success of every Action. It is the component that connects Plan and Action into a coordinated, integrated, targeted solution. 

N = Need

N stands for each company's unique and dynamic need, and need was a critical element in shaping BE GREAT LLC's research to identify the most productive and effective leadership behaviors. Our expertise lies in the intricacies of giving autonomy and not micromanaging, as well as the supporting frontline manager and team leader leadership behaviors we identified in our research, that enable independent successful accountable work. Finding out your unique N drives the scope, value, and effectiveness of our solution. We help you identify N by providing a research-validated solution that helps you answer the question, ""What do we actually need, and why?""

P = Plan

Every successful training solution starts with a Plan. The BE GREAT LLC team has guided and supported some of the most successful development plans, programs, and services in the frontline management development  field. We can customize our program to meet the unique Needs and desired outcomes of each individual client.

A = Action

No Plan succeeds without Action, the step you take to achieve the results you want. Our evidence-based program can help your frontline managers and their people reach their full potential. The Action you take with us to address autonomy in your organization will focus on the specific, identified Needs of these managers and their direct reports.

Determining what skills leaders have, how well they execute them, and how frequently they use them will differ from company to company and manager to manager. To ensure that granting autonomy achieves its promise, frontline managers need to know how well they use their leadership skills and what they need to improve: the ""N"" that shapes both our research and our work with you.",,0.0,,,"{'header_errors': ['Content-Security-Policy header missing', 'X-Frame-Options header missing', 'Referrer-Policy header missing', 'X-XSS-Protection header missing'], 'cookie_errors': [""Cookie missing 'HttpOnly' flag""]}",No privacy policy found on the website.,"Your website is missing important security headers and has cookie settings that could be improved, and without a privacy policy, users may feel uncertain about how their data is handled."

After discovering the power of rituals and Earth consiousness, training back to her roots in European Shamanism, she moved to the peaceful hills of the Marin Zen Center - Green Gulch Farm, Muir Beach - where she got trained into discipline and meditation. That is where she first heard of the Somatic Bodywork which became her expertise, 27 years ago. 

She graduated from the Rosen Method Center in 1995 and continued to assist Marion Rosen and the school for another 4 years.

She became a fervent Yoga practitioner in the late 90's and graduated as Eight -Limbs Ashtanga Yoga instructor in 2002, under the guidance of Baba Hari Das and the Mount Madonna Center with which she stayed involved as an assistant YTT trainer for a few more years.

During her 25 years of practice and studies of other modalities she has developed mastery of the perfect mind-body healing touch, depth of listening and a keen gift for human empowerment.

She has now successfully created a complete online system which combines the Somatic Awareness of her bodywork Bones of Freedom with the intuitive kinesthetic empath gift that she has kept expanding into over the years, her leadership experience as an international workshop and retreats facilitator, and a road map to deep Self-Love and courageous active compassion for the present condition of our beloved planet.","Yemaya Indira, Bringing Healing Magic to Your Life.

Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, the new AI content engine is set to redefine the boundaries of organizational production. By employing advanced algorithms, natural language processing, and data gathering and analytics, this system will have the capability to autonomously research, verify, and generate content across multiple platforms, at unprecedented scales.

Our mission is to empower newsrooms and content providers to scale high-quality original content. This frees up staff time and resources, allowing journalists, marketers and other content providers to spend their time investigating and generating original content.

This innovative approach promises to deliver content promptly, without compromising quality or integrity. In addition to fostering a seamless user experience, the project prioritizes ethical considerations. Measures have been implemented to ensure transparency, accountability, and adherence to strict journalistic-industry principles.

We are led by our CEO and Chief Chocolatier Wendy Lieu, whose heritage and artistry permeates through everything we make. 

Our origins
Co-founded by Wendy and her sister, Susan Lieu, Socola has always been a family endeavor. Wendy always had a passion for chocolate and was dreaming up (and cooking up) her own truffle recipes when she was a teenager. Susan is a perfect counterpart to Wendy, because her talent and acumen was in business and marketing. Susan was always finding and creating ways for more and more people to learn about and experience Socola! 

During the early days, Wendy and Susan couldn't envision what Socola has become. The two sisters started off this business by selling directly to family and friends, setting up in front of their parents' nail salon during the Santa Rosa's Downtown Market in the summertime. Today, Socola is a vibrant business with an amazing team of staff members who work together to create the most stunning chocolates at our brick-and-mortar shop in the middle of San Francisco!

Far-reaching — and also community-centered
Socola has been featured in Forbes, NBC News, the San Francisco Chronicle, Zagat, and has a client list that includes Google, Tiffany, Sephora, and American Express.","Award-winning San Francisco chocolatier offering artisanal chocolate truffles, personalized wedding favors and personalized business gifts.",3.0,2001.0,,"{'connection_error': ""Failed to establish connection: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: Hostname mismatch, certificate is not valid for 'www.socola-chocolates.myshopify.com'.
